To evaluate whether adjuvant therapy with crizotinib will result in improved disease-free survival (DFS) for patients with stage IB >= 4cm, II and IIIA, ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) following surgical resection.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To evaluate and compare overall survival (OS) associated with crizotinib.\r\nII. To evaluate the safety profile of crizotinib when given in the adjuvant therapy setting.\r\nIII. To collect tumor tissue and blood specimens for future research.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\r\n\r\nARM A: Patients receive crizotinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nARM B: Patients undergo observation.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months if < 4 or 5 years from study entry, and every 12 months if 5-10 or 6-10 years from study entry.",

Crizotinib, in an ATP-competitive manner, binds to and inhibits ALK kinase and ALK fusion proteins. In addition, crizotinib inhibits c-Met kinase, and disrupts the c-Met signaling pathway. Altogether, this agent inhibits tumor cell growth. ALK belongs to the insulin receptor superfamily and plays an important role in nervous system development. ALK dysregulation and gene rearrangements are associated with a series of tumors. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent. (NCI Thesaurus)Health professional",

Mutations, or changes, in ALK can make it very active and important for tumor cell growth and progression. Crizotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the ALK protein from working. Crizotinib may be an effective treatment for patients with non-small cell lung cancer and an ALK fusion mutation.",
