Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving pembrolizumab and radiation therapy may increase the benefit of pembrolizumab.",

To assess the efficacy of combining anti-PD-1/PD-L1 blockade with palliative radiation therapy in patients with stage IV Merkel cell carcinoma.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\r\nI. Assessment of overall survival and disease control rate/duration of response (complete response [CR], partial response [PR], stable disease [SD], immune-relate [ir]CR, irPR, irSD).\r\n\r\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. Mutational burden/microsatellite instability (MSI) analysis.\r\nII. Measurement of polyomavirus in the blood.\r\nIII. Immune response assays at baseline, 2 weeks (+/- 1 weeks) and 8 weeks (+/- 1 weeks) after radiation therapy.\r\nIV. Possible tumor biopsy studies.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE:\r\nPatients receive standard of care pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat ever 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo radiation therapy 2-4 weeks after the fourth dose of pembrolizumab (between cycles 1 and 2).\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2-4 weeks, every 3 months for 2 years, then even 6 months for 3 years.",

Upon administration, pembrolizumab binds to PD-1, an inhibitory signaling receptor expressed on the surface of activated T cells, and blocks the binding to and activation of PD-1 by its ligands, which results in the activation of T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. The ligands for PD-1 include PD-L1, which is expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs) and overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and PD-L2, which is primarily expressed on APCs. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation through the suppression of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent.

Optune is a portable device that produces electric fields. The electric fields are delivered to the brain using an adhesive cap that is worn on the head and may slow the growth of tumor cells. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may help the body’s immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving tumor treating fields therapy with Optune device, nivolumab, and ipilimumab may work better in treating patients with melanoma that has spread to the brain compared to nivolumab and ipilimumab alone.",

To determine the progression-free survival of treating melanoma with metastasis to the brain (intracranial and extracranial) with the combination of novoTTF-100A device (Optune) and immunotherapy.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To evaluate the safety of treating melanoma with metastasis to the brain with the combination of Optune and immunotherapy by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0.\r\nII. To determine the overall survival of treating melanoma with metastasis to the brain with the combination of Optune and immunotherapy.\r\n\r\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\r\nI. To correlate circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) analysis with imaging results.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE:\r\nPatients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 2 weeks after starting ipilimumab therapy, patients undergo tumor treating fields therapy using novoTTF-100A device over 14.4 - 18 hours per day for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression and unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 100 days and at 3 years.",

            "detail_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\r\nI. To assess clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined as complete response (CR) + partial response (PR) + stable disease (SD) > 6 months, in the brain in subjects with melanoma brain metastasis (MBM) per modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria who are treatment naive to anti-PD-1 agents in the metastatic setting (prior adjuvant anti-PD1 allowed).\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To assess clinical benefit rate (CBR) in the brain in subjects with MBM per modified RECIST 1.1 in patients who previously progressed on PD-1 inhibitors.\r\nII. To assess overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS).\r\nIII. To evaluate the brain-specific safety and tolerability of the combination regimen in subjects with or without stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) received prior to study entry, or on study.\r\nIV. To evaluate cytokine levels and changes in the T-cell population in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood in patients treated with combination low dose ipilimumab and pembrolizumab.\r\nV. To assess changes in relative apparent diffusion coefficient as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as an early predictor of response.\r\nVI. To assess changes in circulating cfDNA (cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid) as determinants of response and/or markers of early progression.\r\nVII. To evaluate molecular and immunological changes in extracranial lesions.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE:\r\nPatients receive ipilimumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes and pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 4 cycles for ipilimumab and up to 35 cycles for pembrolizumab in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 6 weeks for the first year, and then every 12 weeks thereafter.",

Upon administration, pembrolizumab binds to PD-1, an inhibitory signaling receptor expressed on the surface of activated T cells, and blocks the binding to and activation of PD-1 by its ligands, which results in the activation of T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. The ligands for PD-1 include PD-L1, which is expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs) and overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and PD-L2, which is primarily expressed on APCs. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation through the suppression of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent.

To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) of brigatinib in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring genomic alterations in ALK (excluding lung) and ROS1 (all solid tumors).\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To assess the safety and tolerability of brigatinib in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring genomic alterations in ALK (excluding lung) and ROS1 (all solid tumors).\r\nII. To assess progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced ALK or ROS1 mutated solid tumors treated with brigatinib.\r\nIII. To assess sensitivity and durability of response to brigatinib in different solid tumor types.\r\nIV. To assess the role of intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity in the development of resistance to brigatinib.\r\nV. To identify candidate genomic (including circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA]) and proteomic biomarkers of tumor sensitivity and resistance to brigatinib using high-throughput approaches (exome, transcriptome, reverse phase protein array [RPPA]).\r\n\r\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. Correlation of brigatinib exposure with efficacy and safety.\r\nII. Correlation of tumor and plasma biomarkers with brigatinib efficacy and safety.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE:\r\nPatients receive brigatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. \r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 52 weeks.",

Dual ALK/EGFR inhibitor AP26113 binds to and inhibits ALK kinase and ALK fusion proteins as well as EGFR and mutant forms. This leads to the inhibition of ALK kinase and EGFR kinase, disrupts their signaling pathways and eventually inhibits tumor cell growth in susceptible tumor cells. In addition, AP26113 appears to overcome mutation-based resistance. ALK belongs to the insulin receptor superfamily and plays an important role in nervous system development; ALK dysregulation and gene rearrangements are associated with a series of tumors. EGFR is overexpressed in a variety of cancer cell types. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent. (NCI Thesaurus)Health professional",

The drug Temozolomide is approved to treat brain tumors. Researchers want to see if combining it with the drug T-DMI prevents the formation of new metastases in the brain. Objective: To study if Temozolomide with T-DM1 lowers the chance of having new metastases in the brain. Eligibility: Adults at least 18 years old with a HER2-positive breast cancer that has spread to the brain and was recently treated with stereotactic radiation or surgery. Design: Participants will be screened with - Medical history - Physical exam - Heart tests - A scan (CT) that makes a picture of the body using a small amount of radiation - A scan (MRI) that uses a magnetic field to make an image of the brain - Blood tests. - Pregnancy test. The study will be done in 3-week cycles. All participants will get T-DM1 on Day 1 of every cycle through a small plastic tube inserted in an arm vein. Some participants will also take Temozolomide capsules by mouth every day. Participants will keep a medication diary. During the study, participants will also: - Repeat most of the screening tests. - Answer questions about their general well-being and functioning. Participants will have lumbar puncture at least 2 times. A needle is inserted into the spinal canal low in the back and cerebrospinal fluid is collected. This will be done with local anesthesia and with the help of images. Participants will be asked to provide tumor samples when available. Participants will have a follow-up visit about 1 month after stopping the study drug. They will be contacted by telephone or email every 3 months after that.",
            "detail_description": "Background:\r\n\r\n        -  Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. In the HER2+ subtype, brain metastases\r\n           can occur in up to 25-40% of patients.\r\n\r\n        -  The standard therapy for brain metastases continues to be surgery or stereotactic\r\n           radiosurgery (SRS) and/or whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT).\r\n\r\n        -  Currently, independently of localized or systemic treatment modality, once brain\r\n           metastases are established, options for treatment are limited, and the disease almost\r\n           invariably progresses, limiting not only survival but also quality of life in most\r\n           patients.\r\n\r\n        -  Preclinical literature suggests the hypothesis that preventing the formation of a\r\n           metastasis by a drug may be more efficacious than attempting to shrink an established\r\n           lesion.\r\n\r\n        -  Our group has shown in vitro and in vivo in animal models injected with a brain tropic\r\n           MGMT+ cell line, that even in very low doses temozolomide (TMZ) administered in a\r\n           prophylactic, metronomic fashion can significantly prevent development of brain\r\n           metastases.\r\n\r\n        -  We propose a secondary-prevention clinical trial with oral TMZ given to HER2+ breast\r\n           cancer patients with brain metastases after recent local treatment (SRS or surgical\r\n           resection) in combination with the anti-HER2 agent T-DM1 for systemic control of\r\n           disease.\r\n\r\n      Objectives:\r\n\r\n        -  Phase I (run in): to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TMZ when used in\r\n           combination with T-DM1.\r\n\r\n        -  Phase II: to determine if the combination regimen of T-DM1 and temozolomide improves the\r\n           freedom from distant new brain metastases following stereotactic radiosurgery or\r\n           surgical resection in HER2-positive breast cancer brain metastases, as compared to T-DM1\r\n           alone guided by one-year results as an important benchmark for measuring improvement.\r\n\r\n      Eligibility:\r\n\r\n      Phase I:\r\n\r\n        -  Histologically confirmed HER2+ breast cancer.\r\n\r\n        -  ECOG performance status 0-2 and adequate organ and marrow function.\r\n\r\n        -  Brain metastases, treated within 12 weeks of study entry with SRS, resection or WBRT.\r\n\r\n        -  Patients with leptomeningeal metastatic disease are ineligible.\r\n\r\n        -  Patients that are unable to complete a brain MRI with contrast are ineligible.\r\n\r\n        -  Patients with breast tissue expanders must have those removed before enrollment.\r\n\r\n        -  HBV, HCV or HIV-positive patients are ineligible.\r\n\r\n        -  Patient with impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac disease are\r\n           ineligible.\r\n\r\n        -  Corticosteroids will be allowed at enrollment and during the first month of treatment\r\n           with T-DM1 after SRS, up to a dose of no more than 10mg of dexamethasone daily or\r\n           equivalent. Patients that need to continue corticosteroids after the initial month will\r\n           not be allowed to increase the dose after that period, and will be taken off protocol.\r\n\r\n      Phase II:\r\n\r\n        -  Histologically confirmed HER2+ breast cancer.\r\n\r\n        -  ECOG performance status 0-2 and adequate organ and marrow function.\r\n\r\n        -  1-10 brain metastases, by contrast MRI, treated within 12 weeks of study entry with SRS\r\n           and/or resection.\r\n\r\n        -  Patients with leptomeningeal metastatic disease are ineligible.\r\n\r\n        -  Patients with history of WBRT are ineligible.\r\n\r\n        -  Patients that are unable to complete a brain MRI with contrast are ineligible.\r\n\r\n        -  Patients with breast tissue expanders must have those removed before enrollment.\r\n\r\n        -  HBV, HCV or HIV-positive patients are ineligible.\r\n\r\n        -  Patient with impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac disease are\r\n           ineligible.\r\n\r\n        -  Corticosteroids will be allowed at enrollment and during the first month of treatment\r\n           with T-DM1 after SRS, up to a dose of no more than 10mg of dexamethasone daily or\r\n           equivalent.

During phase II patients will be randomized between T-DM1 plus TMZ versus\r\n           T-DM1 alone.\r\n\r\n        -  Phase I run in: T-DM1 3.6 mg/kg IV every 21 days plus TMZ 30, 40 or 50 mg/m^2 daily.\r\n\r\n        -  Phase II: T-DM1 3.6 mg/kg versus T-DM1 3.6mg/kg plus TMZ at recommended phase 2 dose\r\n           (RP2D).\r\n\r\n        -  Phase I will follow a standard 3+3 design. Thus, with 3 dose levels, up to 18 patients\r\n           may be included in the initial safety evaluation.\r\n\r\n        -  In the phase II portion of the trial, a total of 49 evaluable subjects per arm (98\r\n           total) will need to be randomized over a 3-year period and followed for an additional 2\r\n           years from the date of entry of the last patient, with occurrence of 79 total relapses\r\n           in both arms combined, in order to have 80% power to compare the curves.",

As a cytotoxic alkylating agent, temozolomide is converted at physiologic pH to the short-lived active compound, monomethyl triazeno imidazole carboxamide (MTIC). The cytotoxicity of MTIC is due primarily to methylation of DNA at the O6 and N7 positions of guanine, resulting in inhibition of  DNA replication.  Unlike dacarbazine, which is metabolized to MITC only in the liver, temozolomide is metabolized to MITC at all sites. Temozolomide is administered orally and penetrates well into the central nervous system. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent.

The trastuzumab moiety of this ADC binds to HER2 on tumor cell surface surfaces; upon internalization, the DM1 moiety is released and binds to tubulin, thereby disrupting microtubule assembly/disassembly dynamics and inhibiting cell division and the proliferation of cancer cells that overexpress HER2. Linkage of antibody and drug through a nonreducible linker has been reported to contribute to the improved efficacy and reduced toxicity of this ADC compared to similar ADCs constructed with reducible linkers.

As a cytotoxic alkylating agent, temozolomide is converted at physiologic pH to the short-lived active compound, monomethyl triazeno imidazole carboxamide (MTIC). The cytotoxicity of MTIC is due primarily to methylation of DNA at the O6 and N7 positions of guanine, resulting in inhibition of  DNA replication.  Unlike dacarbazine, which is metabolized to MITC only in the liver, temozolomide is metabolized to MITC at all sites. Temozolomide is administered orally and penetrates well into the central nervous system. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent.

The trastuzumab moiety of this ADC binds to HER2 on tumor cell surface surfaces; upon internalization, the DM1 moiety is released and binds to tubulin, thereby disrupting microtubule assembly/disassembly dynamics and inhibiting cell division and the proliferation of cancer cells that overexpress HER2. Linkage of antibody and drug through a nonreducible linker has been reported to contribute to the improved efficacy and reduced toxicity of this ADC compared to similar ADCs constructed with reducible linkers.

Atezolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Cobimetinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known if giving bevacizumab and atezolizumab with or without cobimetinib will work better in treating patients with melanoma brain metastases.",

In addition, by binding to PD-L1, MPDL3280A also prevents binding of this ligand to B7.1. PD-L1 is overexpressed on many human cancer cell types. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on T-cells suppresses the immune system and results in increased immune evasion. PD-1, a transmembrane protein expressed on activated T-cells, is a negative regulator of the immune system that limits the expansion and survival of CD8+ T cells. The Fc region of MPDL3280A is modified in such a way that it does not induce either antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) or complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC)",

In addition, by binding to PD-L1, MPDL3280A also prevents binding of this ligand to B7.1. PD-L1 is overexpressed on many human cancer cell types. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on T-cells suppresses the immune system and results in increased immune evasion. PD-1, a transmembrane protein expressed on activated T-cells, is a negative regulator of the immune system that limits the expansion and survival of CD8+ T cells. The Fc region of MPDL3280A is modified in such a way that it does not induce either antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) or complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC)",

To compare progression-free survival (PFS) in fulvestrant and tamoxifen citrate (tamoxifen) arms in patients unselected by estrogen receptor (ESR1) mutation, and in the subset of patients with ESR1- mutation (mt) tumors assessed primarily from circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) at enrollment.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. Response rate compared between the tamoxifen and fulvestrant arms in the entire cohort and in the ESR1-mt.\r\nII. Overall survival compared between the tamoxifen and fulvestrant arms in the entire cohort and in the ESR1-mt.\r\nIII. Safety and toxicity assessment.\r\nIV. Clinical benefit rate (defined as complete response [CR]+ partial response [PR]+ stable disease at any tumor assessment) and clinical benefit rate at 6 months (CBR6) (defined as CR+PR+ stable disease for at least 6 months).\r\n\r\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. Assessment of concordance of ESR1 status in plasma and biopsy samples.\r\nII. Assessment of longitudinal changes in circulating levels of ESR1-mt and correlation with response.\r\nIII. Assessment of concordance with metastatic biopsies and archived primary tumor samples, determination of ESR1 status at diagnosis in archived tumor samples.\r\nIV. Assessment of the functionality of ESR1 in tumor biopsies collected prior to and following treatment with fulvestrant as assessed by ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNAseq).\r\n\r\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\r\n\r\nARM A: Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly (IM) on days 1 and 15 of course 1, and on day 1 of each subsequent course. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nARM B: Patients receive tamoxifen citrate orally (PO) daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.",

Tamoxifen competitively inhibits the binding of estradiol to estrogen receptors, thereby preventing the receptor from binding to the estrogen-response element on DNA.  The result is a reduction in DNA synthesis and cellular response to estrogen.  In addition, tamoxifen up-regulates the production of transforming growth factor B (TGFb), a factor that inhibits tumor cell growth, and down-regulates insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), a factor that stimulates breast cancer cell growth. Tamoxifen also down-regulates protein kinase C (PKC) expression in a dose-dependant manner, inhibiting signal transduction and producing an antiproliferative effect in tumors such as malignant glioma and other cancers that overexpress PKC.
