To observe and record anti-tumor activity.\r\nII. To examine preliminary efficacy of CB-839 HCl (telaglenastat) and MLN0128 (sapanisertib) in squamous cell lung cancers (LSCC) and in select, molecularly-defined non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cohorts.\r\nIIa. To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and disease control rate (DCR) of patients treated with CB-839 HCl (telaglenastat) and MLN0128 (sapanisertib).\r\n\r\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To correlate genomic and metabolomic signatures with response.\r\nII. To evaluate metabolic response (18Glutamine [GLN]-positron emission tomography [PET]/computed tomography [CT]; 18Fluorodeoxyglucose [FDG]-PET/CT) in NSCLC tumors treated with CB-839 HCl (telaglenastat) and MLN0128 (sapanisertib) in the dose expansion.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 hydrochloride.\r\n\r\nPatients receive glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and sapanisertib PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up quarterly.",

HER2 and ER are two types of proteins called receptors that can affect the growth of breast cancer cells. Additionally, investigators hope to learn from this study if tumor genetic information is important for predicting whether this type of breast cancer will respond to fulvestrant and copanlisib. Copanlisib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Hormone therapy using fulvestrant may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells. Giving copanlisib and fulvestrant may work better in treating patients with ER+ and HER2- breast cancer compared to fulvestrant alone.",
            "detail_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. Establish safety of the combination of copanlisib and fulvestrant (FC).\r\nII. Evaluate the response rate (RR) of the combination of copanlisib and fulvestrant in patients with estrogen-receptor positive (ER+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative metastatic breast cancer that has previously progressed on aromatase inhibitor (AI)/cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor therapy.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. Estimate progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with copanlisib and fulvestrant stratifying by actionable PIK3CA mutation, actionable PIK3CA or PTEN mutation, or wild type PIK3CA and PTEN.\r\nII. Estimate the RR in subjects with PTEN loss by immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis performed retrospectively.\r\nIII. Evaluate toxicity in patients treated with FC in Phase II.\r\n\r\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. Evaluate copanlisib pharmacokinetics (PK) when given in combination with fulvestrant.\r\nII. Explore association between intrinsic subtype and response to FC therapy.\r\nIII. Assess baseline levels and treatment-induced proteomic changes and correlate with response to FC.\r\nIV. Evaluate circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA) mutations at baseline and over time for response predictors at baseline, clonal evolution associated with treatment, and resistance mechanisms at disease progression.\r\nV. Evaluate PFS in patients with baseline ctDNA PIK3CA actionable mutations versus (vs.) those with wild type PK3CA.\r\nVI. To evaluate genomic and gene expression changes in tumor cells and in associated tumor microenvironment before and after administration of copanlisib in combination with fulvestrant and at the time of progression. \r\nVII. Evaluate circulating markers of metabolism before and after PI3K inhibitor therapy which may predict treatment response and resistance mechanisms.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE:\r\nPatients receive copanlisib intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and fulvestrant intramuscularly (IM) over 1-2 minutes on days 1 and 15 of cycle 1 and on day 1 beginning cycle 2. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.",

            "detail_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\r\nI. To determine for patients with brain metastases meeting the inclusion criteria, whether there is an increase in the time to a composite endpoint of adverse outcomes including the first occurrence of either: local recurrence, leptomeningeal disease, or symptomatic radiation brain necrosis in patients who receive SRS prior to surgery as compared to patients who receive surgery prior to SRS.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To determine for patients with brain metastases whether there is improved overall survival for patients who receive SRS prior to surgery as compared to patients who receive SRS after surgery.\r\nII. To determine for patients with brain metastases whether there are improved patient reported outcomes including quality of life for patients who receive SRS prior to surgery as compared to patients who receive SRS after surgery.\r\nIII. To determine if preoperative SRS increases rates of surgical morbidity including postoperative complications such as wound infection, need for longer hospital stays, or readmission compared to a surgery first approach for resectable brain metastases.\r\nIV. To determine for patients with brain metastases whether there is a higher rate of completion of planned therapies for patients who receive SRS prior to surgery as compared to patients who receive surgery prior to SRS.\r\nV. To determine for patients with brain metastases whether there is a shorter time to initiation or re-initiation of systemic therapy with pre-operative versus post-operative SRS. \r\nVI. To determine for patients treated with pre-operative SRS whether there is a longer interval to regional progression, any central nervous system (CNS) progression or need for subsequent intracranial treatment compared to patients receiving post-operative SRS.\r\nVII. To determine for patients with pre-operative as compared to post-operative radiation whether there is a decreased rate of radiation necrosis, including asymptomatic and symptomatic radiation necrosis.\r\nVIII. To determine for patients with pre-operative as compared to post-operative radiation whether there is a decreased rate of local recurrence.\r\nIX. To determine for patients with pre-operative as compared to post-operative radiation whether there is a decreased rate of leptomeningeal disease.\r\n\r\nCORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To determine the genetic and molecular alterations of brain metastases seen after radiation versus in the setting of resection alone, including early radiobiologic changes in tissue treated with SRS 24 to 48 hours prior, and to investigate detection rate of corresponding circulating deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and/or inflammatory markers in peripheral specimens.\r\nII. To investigate the usefulness of biomarkers and response to radiation in predicting local control and outcomes.\r\nIII. To look at cell capture of tumor cells as well as cell free DNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampled at the time of surgery, comparing patients receiving neoadjuvant treatment to those that have not.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\r\n\r\nARM A: Patients undergo surgery on day 1. Within 2 weeks, patients undergo stereotactic radiosurgery.\r\n\r\nARM B: Patients undergo stereotactic radiosurgery on day 1. Within 4 weeks, patients undergo surgery.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 weeks, every 3-4 months for up to 2 years and then periodically for up to 3 years.",

To determine the safety and tolerability and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of leflunomide in women with previously treated metastatic triple negative breast cancer. (Phase I)\r\nII. To determine the efficacy of leflunomide in patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) PTEN null (30-50% of TNBC) and patients with PTEN wild type. (Phase II)\r\nIII. To evaluate the clinical benefit rate (CBR) (complete response [CR]+partial response [PR]+stable disease [SD]) in women with metastatic TNBC, in two cohorts, one PTEN null, and the other PTEN wild type. (Phase II)\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To describe the adverse events associated with oral leflunomide. (Phase I)\r\nII. To describe the adverse events associated with oral leflunomide. (Phase II)\r\nIII. To measure the objective response rate in those with measurable disease. (Phase II)\r\nIV. To measure the progression free survival (PFS) in the two cohorts of PTEN wild and null TNBC. (Phase II)\r\n\r\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To determine PTEN protein expression.\r\nII. To measure expression of gamma-H2X in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) (express increased in PTEN null tumors relative to PTEN wild-type after treatment with leflunomide.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.\r\n\r\nPatients receive leflunomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.",

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body’s immune system attack the cancer, may induce changes in body’s immune system, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Pertuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Trastuzumab is a form of “targeted therapy” because it works by attaching itself to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as HER2 receptors. When trastuzumab attaches to HER2 receptors, the signals that tell the cells to grow are blocked and the cancer cell may be marked for destruction by the body’s immune system. Giving atezolizumab, pertuzumab, and trastuzumab may work better in treating patients with breast cancer compared to pertuzumab and trastuzumab.",

To evaluate the efficacy of atezolizumab in combination with pertuzumab and high-dose trastuzumab for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) metastases in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC), as measured by overall response rate (ORR) in the CNS according to response assessment in neuro-oncology-brain metastases (RANO-BM) criteria.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To evaluate the safety, and tolerability of the combination of atezolizumab, pertuzumab and high-dose trastuzumab.\r\nII. To evaluate the duration of response (DOR) in the CNS.\r\nIII. To evaluate the efficacy of the study combination, as defined by bi-compartmental progression-free survival (PFS) according to RANO-BM criteria.\r\nIV. To evaluate the CNS response rates according to response assessment in immunotherapy neuro oncology-brain metastases (iRANO-BM) criteria.\r\nV. To evaluate the extracranial ORR according Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria.\r\nVI. To evaluate the extracranial ORR according to immune-related response criteria (irRC).\r\nVII. To evaluate clinical benefit rate at 18 and 24 weeks, defined as the proportion of participants with stable or responsive disease in both CNS and non-CNS at 18 and 24 weeks per RANO-BM criteria.\r\nVIII. To evaluate PFS according to the RECIST 1.1 single-compartmental model.\r\nIX. To describe the site of first progression (CNS versus [vs] extracranial vs both).\r\nX. To evaluate the overall survival (OS) among patients included in this trial.\r\nXI. To evaluate the impact of the experimental treatment on patient-reported outcome (PROs), as measured by the M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT) assessment.\r\nXII. To evaluate the impact of the study treatment, for these same patients, on investigator-assessed neurological evaluation, as measured by the Neurological Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (NANO) scale.\r\nXIII. To evaluate the impact of the study treatment, for these same patients, on general health status assessed by European Quality of Life Five Dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire.\r\n\r\nCORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To explore whether the number and/or type of mutations identified using a next generation sequencing (NGS) panel is correlated with patient outcomes (PFS, CNS ORR, clinical benefit rate [CBR], and OS).\r\nII. To collect blood to study cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for quantification of tumor DNA content and copy number variation, using ultra-low pass whole genome sequencing, and to explore whether cell-free DNA (cfDNA) load is associated with patient outcomes (PFS, CNS ORR, CBR, and OS).\r\nIII. To collect blood to study cell-free DNA for targeted sequencing and/or whole exome sequencing to compare mutations and copy number variation between cfDNA and tumor biopsies.\r\nIV. To characterize a broad array of immune markers in metastatic HER-2 positive breast cancer (characterization will be based on histology, protein expression, and messenger ribonucleic acid [mRNA] expression), and their changes with immune checkpoint blockade.\r\nV. To explore how different immunosuppressive and/or immune-stimulating immune marker profiles at baseline correlate with patient outcomes (PFS, CNS ORR, CBR and OS).\r\nVI. To characterize changes in immune marker profiles on treatment and at time of progression.\r\nVII. To characterize serial changes in immune marker profile in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and in plasma over the course of the trial treatment.\r\nVIII. To explore whether induction of changes in the immunosuppressive and/or immune-stimulating immune marker profile in PBMC correlates with clinical outcomes (PFS, CNS ORR, and OS).\r\nIX. To collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to study cell-free DNA for quantification of tumor DNA content and copy number variation, using ultra-low pass whole genome sequencing, and to compare patterns of cfDNA serially over time in CSF compared to plasma.\r\nX. To explore whether cfDNA load in CSF is associated with clinical outcomes (PFS, CNS ORR, complete response rate [CRR], and OS).\r\nXI. To collect CSF to study cell-free DNA for targeted sequencing and/or whole exome sequencing before, on and after immunotherapy. To compare mutations and copy number variation between cfDNA in plasma versus CSF.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE:\r\nPatients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day 1, pertuzumab IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1, and trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycles 1-8 and day 1 of subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6-12 weeks or 6 months thereafter.",

In addition, by binding to PD-L1, MPDL3280A also prevents binding of this ligand to B7.1. PD-L1 is overexpressed on many human cancer cell types. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on T-cells suppresses the immune system and results in increased immune evasion. PD-1, a transmembrane protein expressed on activated T-cells, is a negative regulator of the immune system that limits the expansion and survival of CD8+ T cells. The Fc region of MPDL3280A is modified in such a way that it does not induce either antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) or complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC)",

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body’s immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Stereotactic body radiation therapy uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This method can kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving pembrolizumab and stereotactic radiosurgery may work better in treating patients with cancer that has spread to the central nervous system.",

To estimate the overall survival of pembrolizumab in leptomeningeal metastases. (Cohort C)\r\nIII. To estimate the systemic overall response rate to the combination of pembrolizumab and intracranial radiation in oligometastatic brain metastases from melanoma. (Cohort D)\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To describe the toxicity of pembrolizumab in brain and leptomeningeal metastases. (Cohorts A, B, C, D)\r\nII. To estimate the overall survival in patients with brain metastases receiving pembrolizumab. (Cohorts A, B, D) \r\nIII. To estimate the central nervous system response rate of pembrolizumab in patients with leptomeningeal metastases. (Cohort C)\r\nIV. To estimate the systemic response rate of pembrolizumab in patients with brain metastases. (Cohorts A, B, C)\r\nV. To estimate the systemic progression free-survival of patients receiving pembrolizumab. (Cohorts A, B, C, D)\r\nVI. To estimate the intracranial progression free-survival of patients receiving pembrolizumab. (Cohorts A, B, C, D)\r\n\r\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To determine molecular biomarkers of response using next generation sequencing techniques.\r\nII. To determine if changes in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters correlate with tumor response.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 cohorts. \r\n\r\nCOHORT A: Patients with measurable central nervous system (CNS) disease or previously untreated brain metastases receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. \r\n\r\nCOHORT B: Patients with measurable CNS disease or progressive brain metastases receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1.\r\n\r\nCOHORT C: Patients with carcinomatous meningitis receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1.\r\n \r\nCOHORT D: Patients with measurable CNS disease or brain metastases receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Patients also undergo stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) between courses 1 and 2.\r\n\r\nFor all cohorts, courses repeat every 21 days for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days, every 6 weeks for up to 6 months, and every 3 months thereafter.",

Upon administration, pembrolizumab binds to PD-1, an inhibitory signaling receptor expressed on the surface of activated T cells, and blocks the binding to and activation of PD-1 by its ligands, which results in the activation of T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. The ligands for PD-1 include PD-L1, which is expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs) and overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and PD-L2, which is primarily expressed on APCs. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation through the suppression of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent.

Upon administration, pembrolizumab binds to PD-1, an inhibitory signaling receptor expressed on the surface of activated T cells, and blocks the binding to and activation of PD-1 by its ligands, which results in the activation of T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. The ligands for PD-1 include PD-L1, which is expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs) and overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and PD-L2, which is primarily expressed on APCs. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation through the suppression of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent.

Upon administration, pembrolizumab binds to PD-1, an inhibitory signaling receptor expressed on the surface of activated T cells, and blocks the binding to and activation of PD-1 by its ligands, which results in the activation of T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. The ligands for PD-1 include PD-L1, which is expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs) and overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and PD-L2, which is primarily expressed on APCs. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation through the suppression of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent.

Upon administration, pembrolizumab binds to PD-1, an inhibitory signaling receptor expressed on the surface of activated T cells, and blocks the binding to and activation of PD-1 by its ligands, which results in the activation of T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. The ligands for PD-1 include PD-L1, which is expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs) and overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and PD-L2, which is primarily expressed on APCs. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation through the suppression of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent.

            "brief_summary": "This phase II trial studies the effect of cesium (Cs)-131 brachytherapy in treating patients with cancer that has spread to the brain from other places in the body (brain metastases) and that has come back (recurrent). Cs-131 brachytherapy involves placing small radioactive seeds (Cs-131 seeds) near the area(s) of the brain where the cancer is being removed. These seeds are permanent, and they temporarily give off radiation to kill any cancer cells that may grow after surgery. Cs-131 brachytherapy may help prevent brain tumors from growing back after surgery.",
            "detail_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\r\nI. To evaluate whether intracavitary Cs131 brachytherapy increases the rate of local central nervous system (CNS) control at 9 months compared to conventional care among patients undergoing elective craniotomy for previously-irradiated brain metastases.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To determine the difference in rates of radiographic and symptomatic radiation necrosis (RN) at 1 year in index lesions treated with brachytherapy compared to those in the non-brachytherapy arm.\r\nII. To characterize the rates of wound complications at 3 months in patients treated with intracavitary Cs131 and patients who are not treated with brachytherapy.\r\nIII. To determine the difference in time to local retreatment at the index site in lesions treated with brachytherapy compared to lesions treated with conventional care.\r\n\r\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To assess neurocognitive functions prior to surgery and at 3 and 12 months postoperatively.\r\nII. To explore correlations between response and tumor type and somatic genomic alterations\r\nIII. To interrogate the immune microenvironment of previously-irradiated brain metastases.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\r\n\r\nARM I: Patients undergo Cs131 brachytherapy implantation during craniotomy.\r\n\r\nARM II: Patients undergo craniotomy.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year then every 6 months for 1 year.",

To determine the brain metastasis response rate in patients with melanoma or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with pembrolizumab plus bevacizumab.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To determine the incidence of steroid use for control of cerebral edema during treatment with pembrolizumab and bevacizumab in combination in patients with metastatic melanoma or NSCLC.\r\nII. To determine the best overall response rate (ORR) in patients with brain metastases from melanoma or NSCLC treated with combination pembrolizumab and bevacizumab.\r\nIII. To evaluate median progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with melanoma or NSCLC metastatic to the brain, treated with pembrolizumab plus bevacizumab.\r\nIV. To determine the safety and toxicity of pembrolizumab in combination with bevacizumab in patients with untreated brain metastases.\r\n\r\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\r\nI. To study programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and other potential predictive biomarkers in central nervous system (CNS), tumors and blood, and correlate results with response to pembrolizumab plus bevacizumab.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE: \r\nPatients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and bevacizumab IV on day 1 of courses 1-4. Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days and then every 3 months thereafter.",

Upon administration, pembrolizumab binds to PD-1, an inhibitory signaling receptor expressed on the surface of activated T cells, and blocks the binding to and activation of PD-1 by its ligands, which results in the activation of T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. The ligands for PD-1 include PD-L1, which is expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs) and overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and PD-L2, which is primarily expressed on APCs. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation through the suppression of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent.
