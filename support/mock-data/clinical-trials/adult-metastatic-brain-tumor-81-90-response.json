            "brief_summary": "Background: EP0057 consists of a sugar molecule cyclodextrin linked to a chemotherapy drug called camptothecin. The combined molecule or \"nanoparticle drug conjugate\" travels through the blood. Once inside cancer cells, the chemotherapy drug is released from the molecule. Olaparib is a drug that may stop cancer cells from repairing the DNA damage caused by chemotherapy. Researchers want to see how safe it is to give EP0057 and olaparib together and to see how well the combination treats a specific type of lung cancer called small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Objectives: To test the safety and maximum dose of EP0057 and olaparib together. To test how well they treat small cell lung cancer. Eligibility: Adults 18 and older with small cell lung cancer. Design: Participants will be screened with standard cancer care tests. Participants will get the 2 study drugs in 28-day cycles. EP0057 will be given every 2 weeks, through a small plastic tube in an arm vein. Olaparib will be taken by mouth twice a day most days. Participants will keep a pill diary. For Cycle 1, participants will have 3 visits. All other cycles will have 2 visits. At study visits, participants may have: - Blood and hair samples taken - History and Physical exam - Questions about health and side effects - Pregnancy test - Optional tumor biopsy where a piece of tumor is removed by needle after numbing the skin. - CT scan - Injection of EP0057 (twice per cycle) - Olaparib prescription <TAB> Participants will have a follow-up visit 4 weeks after finish taking the drugs. They will have a physical exam and blood tests. They may have a tumor biopsy. The study team will call the patient every 3 months for follow up after completing the study treatment.",
            "detail_description": "Background:\r\n\r\n        -  Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis.\r\n\r\n        -  Although highly responsive to chemotherapy initially, SCLC relapses quickly and becomes\r\n           refractory to treatment within a few months.\r\n\r\n        -  Urothelial Carcinoma (UC) of the Bladder is the fourth most common malignancy in men and\r\n           the ninth most common in women.\r\n\r\n        -  Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men in the United States. While prostate\r\n           cancer is initially responsive to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), the median\r\n           duration of sensitivity is 24-36 months. Moreover, patients develop resistance to\r\n           current treatment options.\r\n\r\n        -  The use of PARP inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy builds upon pre-clinical\r\n           data in lung cancer and other cancers supporting the notion that PARP inhibitors\r\n           potentiate the effect of DNA damaging therapies.\r\n\r\n        -  Despite their highly synergistic activity in preclinical models, human studies combining\r\n           PARP inhibitors and camptothecins have not translated into clinical benefit due to\r\n           enhanced toxicity with the combination.\r\n\r\n        -  One approach to improve ability to combine camptothecins with agents that sensitize\r\n           their activity like PARP inhibitors is to use alternative formulations that minimize\r\n           toxicity to the normal tissues.\r\n\r\n        -  EP0057 is a nanoparticle drug conjugate composed of 20 (S)-camptothecin (a potent and\r\n           highly selective topoisomerase I inhibitor) conjugated to a linear,\r\n           cyclodextrinpolyethylene glycol-based polymer.\r\n\r\n        -  Olaparib is a PARP inhibitor indicated as monotherapy in patients with deleterious or\r\n           suspected deleterious germline BRCA mutated advanced ovarian cancer who have been\r\n           treated with three or more prior lines of chemotherapy. Olaparib has an established\r\n           safety profile and it is under investigation in a number of different cancers.\r\n\r\n      Objectives:\r\n\r\n        -  Phase I: To determine the MTD/ recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of EP0057 in combination\r\n           with olaparib in patients with refractory cancers\r\n\r\n        -  Phase II: To determine the antitumor activity of olaparib plus EP0057 with respect to\r\n           progression free survival at 16 weeks in SCLC patients with resistant or sensitive\r\n           relapse\r\n\r\n        -  Expansion Cohorts: To determine overall response rate of EP0057 plus olaparib in\r\n\r\n      patients with mCRPC and urothelial carcinoma\r\n\r\n      Eligibility:\r\n\r\n      Phase I:\r\n\r\n        -  Male or female adult patients greater than or equal to 18 years of age\r\n\r\n        -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed, advanced solid tumor that is refractory to\r\n\r\n      standard therapy and/or for whom no further standard therapy is available\r\n\r\n      -ECOG Performance Status of 0, 1 or 2\r\n\r\n      Phase II:\r\n\r\n        -  Male or female patients greater than or equal to 18 years old\r\n\r\n        -  Have a pathologically (histology or cytology) confirmed diagnosis of SCLC\r\n\r\n        -  Disease progression on or after at least one platinum-based standard chemotherapy\r\n\r\n      regimen and/or an immune-checkpoint inhibitor for either limited or extensive stage\r\n\r\n      disease.\r\n\r\n        -  Have measurable disease per RECIST 1.1\r\n\r\n        -  ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2\r\n\r\n      Phase II Expansion Cohorts:\r\n\r\n      -Have a pathologically (histology or cytology) confirmed diagnosis of urothelial\r\n\r\n      carcinoma or metastatic, progressive, castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC)\r\n\r\n      -Disease progression on or after at least one platinum-based standard chemotherapy\r\n\r\n      regimen and/or an immune-checkpoint inhibitor (except prostate cohort)\r\n\r\n        -  Have measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 (except prostate cohort)\r\n\r\n        -  Prior treatment with enzalutamide and/or abiraterone (prostate cancer cohort only)\r\n\r\n        -  Patients must have castrate levels of testosterone (<50 ng/dl [1.74 nmol/l]) (Prostate\r\n\r\n      cohort only)\r\n\r\n      Design:\r\n\r\n        -  Patients meeting eligibility criteria will receive EP0057 (IV Q 2weeks) plus olaparib\r\n           (PO BID days 3-13 and days 17-26 administered in 28 day cycles, until disease\r\n           progression or development of intolerable side effects. The MTD of the combination will\r\n           be used in Phase II.\r\n\r\n        -  Patients in Phase II will receive, the RP2D at DL4R EP005712mg/m2 and olaparib 250mg\r\n           BID.\r\n\r\n        -  Blood, tumor and hair samples will be collected at multiple time points for PK, PD\r\n           analyses. Hair sample collection is optional. Tumor biopsies are optional for SCLC and\r\n           UC patients and mandatory for mCRPC patients (only baseline biopsy is mandatory).\r\n\r\n        -  Toxicity will be graded according to CTCAE version 4.0.\r\n\r\n        -  Tumor assessments will be made using CT scans (chest, abdomen and pelvis) at baseline\r\n           and after every 2 cycles (3 cycles for mCRPC) according to RECIST version 1.1.\r\n\r\n        -  After discontinuation of study treatment, follow-up for survival will be carried out\r\n           every 3 months.\r\n\r\n        -  The maximum number of patients on the phase I portion of the trial is 30, the SCLC\r\n           cohort in phase II may accrue up to 27 evaluable patients, urothelial carcinoma\r\n           expansion cohort may accrue up to 34 patients and mCRPC may accrue up to 25 patients.\r\n           Thus, the maximum number of evaluable patients who may enroll on this trial is 116. In\r\n           order to allow for a small number of in-evaluable patients, the accrual ceiling will be\r\n           set at 123.\r\n\r\n        -  It is anticipated that approximately 1 to 2 patients per month may enroll onto this\r\n           trial; the trial is expect to complete accrual in 6-8 years.",

Olaparib selectively binds to and inhibits PARP, inhibiting PARP-mediated repair of single strand DNA breaks; PARP inhibition may enhance the cytotoxicity of DNA-damaging agents and may reverse tumor cell chemoresistance and radioresistance. PARP catalyzes post-translational ADP-ribosylation of nuclear proteins and can be activated by single-stranded DNA breaks. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent.

Brain metastases are tumors that have spread to the brain from another place in the body. SRS is a specialized radiation therapy that delivers a single, high dose of radiation directly to the tumor and may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue.",

To identify the maximal tolerated doses for single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery, within 90 days from the date of procedure, in patients with brain metastases who have not undergone prior brain irradiation.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To evaluate the overall survival (OS), which is defined as the time between date of SRS and the date of death due to any cause.\r\nII. To evaluate time to progression (TTP), which is defined as the time between date of SRS and date of documented progression.\r\nIII. To evaluate the local progression rate of the target lesion.\r\nIV. To evaluate the response rate, consisting of complete response (CR) and partial response according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.\r\nV. To measure the improvement in health-related quality of life (HRQoL).\r\nVI. To identify the chronic toxicity for single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery, after 90 days up to 3 years from the date of procedure, in patients with brain metastases who have not undergone prior brain irradiation.\r\nVII. To perform subgroup analysis of the variables listed above.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.\r\n\r\nPatients undergo SRS, typically on day 1 only. Multiple sessions are allowed, as long as all lesions are treated within 14 days. \r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for the first 12 months and then every 6 months until 3 years.",

            "brief_summary": "This pilot and randomized phase II trial studies how well glyburide works in treating brain swelling in participants with cancer that has spread to the brain undergoing stereotactic radiosurgery. Glyburide may work by reducing swelling from tumors in the brain.",
            "detail_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To determine the feasibility and safety of administering oral glyburide to non‐diabetic patients receiving stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for newly diagnosed brain metastases. (Pilot portion)\r\nII. To determine the number of patients with newly diagnosed brain metastases who have an increase in edema as measured on volumetric fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging and the number of patients that require dexamethasone administration (or any corticosteroid administration with the purpose of treating cerebral edema) from the day of SRS to one month follow‐up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the group receiving glyburide versus placebo. (Randomized portion)\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES: \r\nI. To assess the volume transfer constant (ktrans) value degree of change between the treatment groups.\r\nII. To assess the FLAIR volume and FLAIR ratio degree of change between the treatment groups.\r\nIII. To assess the rate of symptomatic progression requiring dexamethasone (or any corticosteroid administration with the purpose of treating cerebral edema) between the treatment groups.\r\nIV. To assess differences in local control between the treatment groups.\r\nV. To assess differences in neurologic toxicities between the treatment groups.\r\nVI. To assess differences in cardiac and hepatobiliary toxicities between the treatment groups.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE: \r\nPILOT PORTION: Participants receive glyburide orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -5 to 30 and undergo SRS on day 0.\r\n \r\nRANDOMIZED PORTION: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\r\n\r\nARM I (GLYBURIDE): Participants receive glyburide PO BID on days -5 to 30 and undergo SRS on day 0.\r\n\r\nARM II (PLACEBO): Participants receive placebo PO BID on days -5 to 30 and undergo SRS  on day 0.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 and 90 days.",

To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and safety of fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) when treating brain metastases.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To evaluate the local control associated with this therapy.\r\nII. To evaluate regional intracranial failure associated with this therapy.\r\nIII. To evaluate the Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) associated with this therapy.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.\r\n\r\nPatients undergo fractionated SRS every other day for up to 2 weeks.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days, at 8-12 weeks and then every 8-12 weeks for 24 months.",

To demonstrate the safety and feasibility of treating brain metastases or resection cavities greater than 3 cm with hypofractionated radiosurgery and to determine the maximum-tolerated radiation dose for hypofractionated radiosurgery (HR) delivered in 5 fractions, 2-3 fractions per week. \r\n\r\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.\r\n\r\nPatients undergo hypofractionated stereotactic radiosurgery 2-3 times weekly (5 fractions total) for 2-3 weeks.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 and 4 months and then every 3 months thereafter.",

To determine local control of brain metastases at 4 months after initial treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in patients with > 3 melanoma brain metastases (MBM).\r\nII. To determine cognitive decline at 4 months defined as a significant decline (>= 5 point decrease from baseline based on the reliable change index) in the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) Total Recall after initial treatment with SRS versus whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) in patients with > 3 MBMs.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To determine local tumor control and distal tumor control in the brain at 1, 4, 6, 9 and 12 months post-treatment.\r\nII. To determine overall survival in treated patients.\r\nIII. To assess the pattern of neurocognitive change in memory at 1, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months post-treatment as well as executive function, attention, processing speed and upper extremity fine motor dexterity.\r\nIV. To evaluate composite neurocognitive function scores in treated patients.\r\nV. To assess the pre-treatment factors of age, Karnofsky performance scale (KPS), extra-cranial disease, BRAF-V600E mutation status in the predictive determination of local and distal control and neurocognitive outcome in each treatment arm.\r\nVI. To assess the correlation between number of lesions and total volume of intracranial disease and neurocognitive outcome in each treatment arm.\r\nVII. To document post-treatment adverse side effects in treated patients.\r\nVIII. Evaluate the time to initiation of systemic therapy from completion of radiation treatment.\r\nIX. Evaluate the duration/number of cycles of systemic chemotherapy given following radiation treatment.\r\n\r\nCORRELATIVE STUDIES:\r\nI. To determine if apolipoprotein E (Apo E) (i.e., Apo E2, Apo E3, and Apo E4) genotyping may prove to be a predictor of radiation induced neurocognitive decline (or neuro-protection).\r\nII. To determine if inflammatory markers (i.e., IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-alpha) may prove to be predictors of radiation induced neurocognitive decline.\r\nIII. To determine if hormone and growth factors (i.e., glucocorticoids [e.g., cortisol], gonadal steroids [e.g., estradiol, testosterone, progesterone], growth hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), insulin-like growth factor-1 [IGF-1], and neuronal growth factor [NGF]) may prove to be a predictor of radiation induced neurocognitive decline.\r\nIV. To assess whether baseline and post-radiation fludeoxyglucose F-18 (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scans can predict for neurocognitive decline.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE:\r\nPatients undergo SRS on day 1.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 months.",

            "brief_summary": "This randomized phase III clinical trial compares stereotactic radiosurgery with whole brain radiation therapy to see how well they work in treating patients with non-melanoma cancer that has recently spread from the first location to the brain. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a specialized type of radiation therapy that delivers a single, high dose of radiation directly to the tumor and may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Whole brain radiation therapy delivers a lower dose of radiation to the entire brain over several treatments. It is not yet known whether stereotactic radiosurgery works better than whole brain radiation therapy in treating patients with non-melanoma brain metastases. Stereotactic radiosurgery may also cause fewer thinking and memory problems than whole brain radiation therapy.",
            "detail_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: \r\nI. To compare local tumor control 4 months after treatment of patients with 4 to 15 intracranial non-melanoma metastases at the time of enrollment (=< 15 at time of treatment) treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) versus (vs.) whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) in a prospective randomized trial.\r\nII. To compare cognitive decline at 4 months defined as a significant decline (5 point decrease from baseline based on the reliable change index) in Hopkins Verbal Learning Test - Revised (HVLT-R) Total Recall after initial treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) versus whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) in patients with 4 to 15 non-melanoma brain metastases at the time of enrollment (=< 15 at time of treatment).\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES: \r\nI. To determine local control and distant tumor control in the brain at 1, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months post treatment.\r\nII. To determine overall survival in each treatment arm.\r\nIII. To assess the pattern of neurocognitive change in memory at 1, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months post-treatment as well as executive function, attention, processing speed, and upper extremity fine motor dexterity.\r\nIV. To evaluate the composite neurocognitive function score for both treatment arms.\r\nV. To assess the pre-treatment factors of age, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), and extra-cranial disease in the predictive determination of local and distant control and neurocognitive outcome in each treatment arm.\r\nVI. To assess the correlation between number of lesions and total volume of intracranial disease and neurocognitive outcome in each treatment arm.\r\nVII. To compare time to initiation of systemic therapy from completion of radiotherapy between the two treatment arms.\r\nVIII. To compare number of cycles of systemic therapy delivered following completion of radiation treatment in the two treatment arms.\r\nIX. To document and descriptively compare post-treatment adverse side effects between the two treatment arms.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. \r\n\r\nARM I: Patients undergo SRS on day 1.\r\n\r\nARM II: Patients undergo WBRT 5 days per week (7 days per week for inpatients) for 2 weeks. \r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months.",

To perform early phase clinical trial assessing safety and clinical toxicity of immunization, and as well as to establish an optimal biological dose (OBD) of combination vaccines with n-muramyldipeptide derivative (nor-MDP) as adjuvant emulsified in ISA 720. (Dose Escalation Phase)\r\nII. To establish whether an optimal biological dose (OBD) of two combination vaccines is achieved. (Dose Escalation Phase)\r\nIII. To measure both humoral and cellular immune responses including the specificity, class and kinetics of anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) peptide. (Dose Escalation Phase)\r\nIV. To evaluate whether the combination of HER-2 epitopes show therapeutic benefit, provide synergistic and/or additive effects and to enumerate mechanisms of action. (Dose Escalation Phase)\r\nV. To obtain preliminary estimates of efficacy of the combination of HER-2 vaccines in breast, ovarian and gastrointestinal cancers. (Expansion Phase)\r\nVI. To characterize further the safety profile of immunization with combination of HER-2 epitopes. (Expansion Phase)\r\nVII. To determine both humoral and cellular immune responses including the specificity, class and kinetics of anti-HER-2 peptide. (Expansion Phase)\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To collect and analyze post-immune sera and peripheral blood cells for additional six months post the last injection. (Dose Escalation Phase)\r\nII. To document any clinical responses that may occur. (Dose Escalation Phase)\r\nIII. To collect and analyze post-immune sera and peripheral blood cells for additional six months following the last injection. (Expansion Phase)\r\nIV. To analyze serum biomarkers from cancer patients using Bio-Plex Suspension Array System. (Expansion Phase)\r\nV. To analyze cytokines in response to vaccination. (Expansion Phase)\r\n\r\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.\r\n\r\nPatients receive a HER2/neu peptide vaccine comprising measles virus fusion protein (MVF)-HER-2 (266-296) and MVF-HER-2 (597-626) emulsified with nor-MDP in ISA 720 intramuscularly (IM) on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.",

Patients who with advanced breast cancer who have failed prior therapies will be eligible to enroll in this study. The study will evaluate SV-BR-1-GM in combination with INCMGA00012 and epacadostat. Treatment cycles will be every 3 weeks with evaluations for tumor progression or response every 6-12 weeks.",
            "detail_description": "This is an open-label, single arm study of the SV-BR-1-GM regimen in combination with\n      INCMGA00012 and epacadostat in patients with metastatic or locally recurrent breast cancer\n      who have failed at least two lines of therapy.\n\n      Patients will receive the SV-BR-1-GM regimen with combination immunotherapy. There will be an\n      initial evaluation of the combination of the SV-BR-1-GM regimen with INCMGA00012 every 3\n      weeks. If this is found to be safe and well tolerated in a cohort of at least 6 patients\n      (dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in less than 30% of the patients evaluated), then a triple\n      combination of the SV-BR-1-GM regimen with INCMGA00012 and epacadostat will be evaluated in a\n      cohort of 6 patients. If the DLT rate remains below 30%, additional higher dose levels of\n      epacadostat will be explored. Once a dose of epacadostat has been determined that is safe and\n      reliably normalizes plasma kynurenine levels, the study will expand to treat an additional 36\n      patients. If DLTs are seen in 30% or more of patients, the dose of epacadostat will be\n      further reduced and an additional cohort of 6 patients evaluated in a stepwise fashion until\n      a safe dose level is determined. Once the recommended phase II dose is determined, the study\n      will expand to treat an additional 36 patients.\n\n      The SV-BR-1-GM regimen consists of:\n\n        1. Pre- SV-BR-1-GM cyclophosphamide 2-3 days prior to SV-BR-1-GM inoculation\n\n        2. SV-BR-1-GM inoculation\n\n        3. Interferon-alpha-2b - at the inoculation sites 2 (±1 day) post-SV-BR-1-GM\n\n        4. Interferon-alpha-2b - at the inoculation sites 4 (±1 day) post-SV-BR-1-GM\n\n      The SV-BR-1-GM regimen will be administered with the following combination immunotherapy\n      regimen:\n\n        1. Combination therapy with INCMGA00012 (anti-PD-1)\n\n        2. Combination therapy with epacadostat (IDO inhibitor)\n\n      The SV-BR-1-GM regimen with INCMGA00012 will be administered every 21 days (± 3 days), except\n      when approved by the Investigator in consultation with the medical monitor. Epacadostat will\n      be dosed twice daily and will continue through each cycle. Note that hormonal therapy (e.g.,\n      aromatase inhibitors) is permitted if ongoing, but may be added while the patient is on this\n      study only with the medical monitor's approval (e.g. for hormone receptor positive patients\n      who are deriving clinical benefit but have not achieved a CR after >6 cycles of therapy).",

By inhibiting IDO1 and decreasing kynurenine in tumor cells, INCB024360 increases and restores the proliferation and activation of various immune cells, including dendritic cells (DCs), NK cells, and T-lymphocytes, as well as interferon (IFN) production, and a reduction in tumor-associated regulatory T cells (Tregs). Activation of the immune system, which is suppressed in many cancers, may inhibit the growth of IDO1-expressing tumor cells. IDO1 is overexpressed by a variety of tumor cell types and DCs.

By inhibiting IDO1 and decreasing kynurenine in tumor cells, INCB024360 increases and restores the proliferation and activation of various immune cells, including dendritic cells (DCs), NK cells, and T-lymphocytes, as well as interferon (IFN) production, and a reduction in tumor-associated regulatory T cells (Tregs). Activation of the immune system, which is suppressed in many cancers, may inhibit the growth of IDO1-expressing tumor cells. IDO1 is overexpressed by a variety of tumor cell types and DCs.

This study will take place in two parts. Stage 1 will be the safety cohort (13 patients) to determine the recommended dose of AE37 vaccine that can safely be administered with pembrolizumab. Stage 2 will be an expansion cohort (16 patients) that will consist of the recommended dose of AE37 determined in Stage 1.",
            "detail_description": "The FB-14 is an open label, phase II study using pembrolizumab in combination with AE37\n      peptide vaccine (AE37) in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC).\n\n      This study will have a Simon two-stage design. In Stage I (safety cohort), 13 patients will\n      receive combination therapy of AE37 vaccine (without granulocyte macrophage-colony\n      stimulating factor [GM-CSF] adjuvant) 1000 micrograms in two split intradermal injections on\n      Day 1 of cycles 1 through 5 and pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenous infusion (IV) given Day 1 of\n      each cycle for 2 years (1 cycle equals 21 days).\n\n      All patients (safety and expansion cohorts) will receive two delayed type hypersensitivity\n      inoculations (DTH): the first within one week prior to beginning study therapy, which must\n      meet the parameters of negative inoculation site assessment for eligibility as described in\n      the protocol; and the second approximately 42 days after the last AE37 vaccine dose.\n\n      During a safety run-in, the first 3 patients will be closely followed for 6 weeks following\n      the first dose of study therapy (2 cycles) without further accrual of patients. If one or\n      less of the first 3 patients experience greater than or equal to Grade 3 systemic dose\n      limiting toxicity (DLT) attributable to study therapy during the observation period, the\n      safety run-in portion of the study will proceed with enrollment at the proposed study therapy\n      dose (AE37 1000 micrograms and pembrolizumab 200 mg IV infusion). If there are two or more\n      patients in the safety run-in with DLT during Cycle 1, the dose of AE37 will be decreased to\n      dose level −1 (500 micrograms) to complete stage I accrual. The definition of a DLT is found\n      in the protocol.\n\n      If DLT is observed during the safety run-in or in greater than 25% (4 or more) of patients in\n      stage I, the AE37 dose will be de-escalated to 500 micrograms (dose level −1) for all\n      patients to complete stage I accrual. If systemic toxicity occurs in greater than or equal to\n      3 patients at dose level −1, accrual will be halted and the toxicity reviewed by the study\n      team.",

Upon vaccination, AE37 may activate the immune system and stimulate T-helper cells against HER2/Neu expressing cancer cells. GM-CSF may potentiate the immune response against cancer cells expressing the HER2/Neu antigen. The Ii-Key moiety, a 4-amino acid (LRMK) epitope from the MHC class II-associated invariant chain (Ii protein), increases T-helper cell stimulation against HER2/neu antigen when compared to unmodified class II epitopes. HER2/neu, a tumor associated antigen (TAA), is overexpressed in a variety of tumor cell types and is highly immunogenic. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent.

                            "intervention_description": "A vaccine containing HER2/Neu-derived epitope (amino acids 776-790) linked to li-Key peptide (li-Key/HER2/neu hybrid peptide or AE37), and combined with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), with potential antineoplastic and immunoadjuvant activities. Upon vaccination, AE37 may activate the immune system and stimulate T-helper cells against HER2/Neu expressing cancer cells. GM-CSF may potentiate the immune response against cancer cells expressing the HER2/Neu antigen. The Ii-Key moiety, a 4-amino acid (LRMK) epitope from the MHC class II-associated invariant chain (Ii protein), increases T-helper cell stimulation against HER2/neu antigen when compared to unmodified class II epitopes. HER2/neu, a tumor associated antigen (TAA), is overexpressed in a variety of tumor cell types and is highly immunogenic. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent.

Upon administration, pembrolizumab binds to PD-1, an inhibitory signaling receptor expressed on the surface of activated T cells, and blocks the binding to and activation of PD-1 by its ligands, which results in the activation of T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. The ligands for PD-1 include PD-L1, which is expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs) and overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and PD-L2, which is primarily expressed on APCs. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation through the suppression of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent.
