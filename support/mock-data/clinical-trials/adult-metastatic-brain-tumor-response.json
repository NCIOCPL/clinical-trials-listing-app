Several genes have been found to be altered or mutated in brain metastases such as NTRK, ROS1, CDK or PI3K. Medications that target these genes such as abemaciclib, GDC-0084, and entrectinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Genetic testing may help doctors tailor treatment for each mutation.",

CDK4/6 dual inhibitor LY2835219 specifically inhibits CDK4 and 6, thereby inhibiting retinoblastoma (Rb) protein phosphorylation in early G1. Inhibition of Rb phosphorylation prevents CDK-mediated G1-S phase transition, thereby arresting the cell cycle in the G1 phase, suppressing DNA synthesis and inhibiting cancer cell growth. Overexpression of the serine/threonine kinases CDK4/6, as seen in certain types of cancer, causes cell cycle deregulation. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent.

Upon administration, TrkA/B/C/ROS1/ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor RXDX-101 binds to and inhibits TrkA, TrkB, TrkC, ROS1 and ALK. Inhibition of these kinases may result in a disruption of TrkA-, TrkB-, TrkC-, ROS1-, and ALK-mediated signaling. This leads to an induction of apoptosis and an inhibition of tumor cell proliferation in tumor cells that express these kinases. TrkA, TrkB, TrkC, ROS1 and ALK are overexpressed in a variety of cancer cell types. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent. (NCI Thesaurus)Health professional",

Encorafenib and binimetinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab and nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the tumor, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. This trial aims to find out which approach is more effective in shrinking and controlling brain metastases from melanoma.",
            "detail_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\r\nI. To compare progression-free survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 between participants randomized to the triplet combination of encorafenib + binimetinib + nivolumab versus the doublet combination of ipilimumab + nivolumab among participants with BRAF-V600 mutant melanoma that has metastasized to the brain.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To estimate the overall survival (OS) of participants in each treatment arm.\r\nII. To estimate the objective response rate (ORR) (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial responses) per RECIST 1.1 in each treatment arm.\r\nIII. To estimate the intracranial response rate (ICRR), defined as confirmed and unconfirmed complete and partial response per modified RECIST for brain metastases (mRECIST).\r\nIV. To evaluate the duration of response, per RECIST 1.1 and the duration of ICRR per mRECIST, and per Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO)-Brain Metastases (BM) (and immunotherapy [i]RANO) in each treatment arm.\r\nV. To evaluate the toxicity profile of each treatment arm.\r\nVI. To evaluate current and emerging radiographic response criteria (modified RECIST 1.1, modified RANO-BM and iRANO) by a retrospective blinded independent centralized review (BICR) of banked images.\r\n\r\nBANKING OBJECTIVE:\r\nI. To bank tumor tissue, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), stool and blood samples for future correlative studies.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\r\n\r\nARM I: Patients receive encorafenib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28, binimetinib PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-28, and nivolumab intravenously (IV) on day 1. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nARM II: Patients receive nivolumab IV on day 1 of all cycles and ipilimumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 of cycles 1-4. Cycles repeat every 21 days for 4 cycles and then every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually until 3 years after randomization.",

This may eventually lead to an inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and an inhibition in production of various inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1, -6 and tumor necrosis factor. MEK1/2 are dual-specificity threonine/tyrosine kinases that play key roles in the activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway and are often upregulated in a variety of tumor cell types.

Single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery is a specialized radiation therapy that delivers a single, high dose of radiation directly to the tumor and may cause less damage to normal tissue. Fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery delivers multiple, smaller doses of radiation therapy over time. This study may help doctors find out if fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery is better or worse than the usual approach with single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery.",

To ascertain in patients with resected brain metastases whether there is improved overall QOL as assessed by the FACT-BR and Linear Analog Self-Assessment (LASA) in patients who receive FSRS compared to patients who receive SSRS (Secondary QOL objective).\r\nIV. To compare the functional independence in patients who receive FSRS to patients who receive SSRS.\r\nV. To tabulate and descriptively compare the post-treatment adverse events associated with the interventions, including the potential impact of immunotherapy and targeted therapy.\r\nVI. To compare rates of radiation necrosis at 12 months in patients who receive FSRS to patients who receive SSRS.\r\nVII. To evaluate if there is any difference in central nervous system (CNS) failure patterns (local, distant brain failure, local leptomeningeal disease, widespread leptomeningeal disease) in patients who receive FSRS compared to patients who receive SSRS after resection of brain metastasis.\r\nVIII. To ascertain in patients with resected brain metastases whether there is increased time to whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) in patients who receive FSRS compared to patients who receive SSRS.\r\nIX. To determine in long-term survivors (patients who are alive more than 12 months from time of randomization) whether there is better emotional well-being and overall QOL as assessed by the FACT-BR and LASA in patients who receive FSRS to the surgical bed compared to patients who receive SSRS (Secondary QOL objective).\r\nX. To ascertain if time to surgical bed failure as assessed by central review is increased with FSRS compared to SSRS in patients with resected brain metastasis.\r\nXI. To ascertain in patients with resected brain metastases whether there is improved QOL as assessed by all other total and individual FACT-BR and LASA items and subscale values in patients who receive FSRS compared to patients who receive SSRS (Exploratory QOL objective). \r\nXII. To determine in patients with resected brain metastases whether there is less cognitive progression in patients who receive FSRS to the surgical bed compared to patients who receive SSRS (Exploratory cognitive objective). \r\n\r\nCORRELATIVE SCIENCE OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To collect and bank blood and tissue for future correlative studies.\r\nII. To ascertain if there are differences in local site versus centrally reviewed scan-reads; specifically differences in dates of progression or patterns of failure. \r\nIII. To differentiate tumor recurrence and radiation necrosis using an image-based biomechanically-coupled tumor growth model to estimate patient-specific model parameters and model-derived measures.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\r\n\r\nARM I: Patients undergo SSRS over 1 session.\r\n\r\nARM II: Patients undergo FSRS over 3 or 5 daily sessions.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study, patients are followed up at 30 days, at 3, 6, 9, 12, 16, and 24 months, then every 6 months until 5 years from randomization.",

Sacituzumab govitecan is a monoclonal antibody, called sacituzumab, linked to a chemotherapy drug, called govitecan. Sacituzumab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules on the surface of cancer cells, known as Trop-2 receptors, and delivers govitecan to kill them. Giving sacituzumab govitecan may shrink the cancer in the brain and / or extend the time until the cancer gets worse.",

To evaluate the intracranial objective response rate (ORR) (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR] by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Brain Metastases [RANO-BM]) with sacituzumab govitecan (IMMU-132) in patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer with brain involvement.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To evaluate bi-compartmental progression-free survival in this population.\r\nII. To evaluate overall survival in this population.\r\nIII. To assess safety and tolerability of sacituzumab govitecan (IMMU-132) treatment in this population.\r\nIV. To evaluate ORR by hormone-receptor (HR) subgroup (HR+, HR-).\r\n\r\nBANKING OBJECTIVE:\r\nI. To bank specimens for future correlative studies.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE:\r\nPatients receive sacituzumab govitecan intravenously (IV) over 1-3 hours on days 1 and 8. Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study registration, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 1 year.",

The antibody moiety of IMMU-132 selectively binds to TROP2. After internalization and proteolytic cleavage, SN-38 selectively stabilizes topoisomerase I-DNA covalent complexes, resulting in DNA breaks that inhibit DNA replication and trigger apoptosis. TROP2, also known as epithelial glycoprotein-1 (EGP-1), is a transmembrane calcium signal transducer that is overexpressed by a variety of human epithelial carcinomas; this antigen is involved in the regulation of cell-cell adhesion and its expression is associated with increased cancer growth, aggressiveness and metastasis.

            "brief_summary": "This phase III trial studies stereotactic radiosurgery to see how well it works compared to hippocampus avoidance whole-brain radiation therapy with memantine in treating patients with 5-15 brain tumors that have spread from other places in the body. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a specialized radiation therapy that delivers a single, high dose of radiation directly to the tumor and may cause less damage to normal tissue. Hippocampus avoidance whole-brain radiation therapy delivers radiation to the entire brain except for the hippocampus. The hippocampus is a brain structure that is important for memory. Hippocampus avoidance during whole-brain radiation therapy decreases the amount of radiation that is delivered to this area. Memantine is often given with whole brain radiation therapy and may decrease the risk of cognitive side effects after radiation therapy to the brain. It is not yet known whether stereotactic radiosurgery or whole-brain radiation therapy works better in treating patients with 5-15 brain metastases.",
            "detail_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To compare the overall survival in patients with five to fifteen brain metastases who receive stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) compared to patients who receive hippocampal-avoidant whole-brain radiation therapy (HA-WBRT) plus memantine hydrochloride (memantine).\r\nII. To compare the neurocognitive progression-free survival in patients with five to fifteen brain metastases who receive SRS compared to patients who receive HA-WBRT plus memantine.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To compare time to central nervous system (CNS) failure (local, distant, and leptomeningeal) in patients who receive SRS compared to patients who receive HA-WBRT plus memantine.\r\nII. To evaluate if there is any difference in CNS failure patterns (local, distant, or leptomeningeal) in patients who receive SRS compared to patients who receive HA-WBRT plus memantine.\r\nIII. To evaluate number of salvage procedures following SRS in comparison to HA-WBRT plus memantine.\r\nIV. To evaluate the individual cognitive test results following SRS in comparison to HA-WBRT plus memantine.\r\nV. To tabulate and descriptively compare the post-treatment adverse events associated with the interventions.\r\nVI. To evaluate the time delay to (re-)initiation of systemic therapy in patients receiving SRS in comparison to HA-WBRT plus memantine.\r\nVII. To prospectively validate a predictive nomogram for distant brain failure.\r\nVIII. To compare the estimated cost of brain-related therapies in patients who receive SRS compared to patients who receive HA-WBRT plus memantine.\r\nIX. To evaluate patient’s quality of life, as assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (QLQ-C30) + Brain Cancer Module (BN20), European Quality of Life-5-Dimensional (EQ-5D), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, for those who receive SRS compared to those who receive HA-WBRT plus memantine.\r\nX. Collect plasma to evaluate whether detectable somatic mutations in liquid biopsy can enhance prediction of the overall survival and development of new brain metastases.\r\nXI. Analysis of serum samples for inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein and brain-derived-neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to elucidate molecular/genomic mechanisms of neurocognitive decline and associated radiographic changes.\r\nXII. Collect whole-brain dosimetry on all patients to be prospectively correlated with cognitive toxicity, intracranial control and radiation necrosis (hippocampal dosimetry will be retrospectively assessed).\r\nXIII. Collect imaging parameters and workflow details relating to the radiosurgery planning MRIs (including timing of MR prior to radiosurgery, magnet field strength, contrast type/dose/timing, use of image post-processing, and formal reviewed by radiology) to be prospectively correlated with tumor control outcomes (local control, intracranial control).\r\nXIV. Evaluate serial changes in imaging features found in routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images (T2w changes, morphometry) that may predict tumor control and/or neurocognitive outcomes\r\n\r\nOUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\r\n\r\nARM I: Patients receive memantine hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for up to 24 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo 10 fractions of HA-WBRT daily for up to 3 weeks.\r\n\r\nARM II: Patients undergo 1 fraction of SRS.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 8 weeks, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, and 24 months, then annually afterwards.",

This may eventually lead to an inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and an inhibition in production of various inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1, -6 and tumor necrosis factor.

Binimetinib, noncompetitive with ATP, binds to and inhibits the activity of MEK1/2. Inhibition of MEK1/2 prevents the activation of MEK1/2-dependent effector proteins and transcription factors, which may result in the inhibition of growth factor-mediated cell signaling. This may eventually lead to an inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and an inhibition in production of various inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1, -6 and tumor necrosis factor. MEK1/2 are dual-specificity threonine/tyrosine kinases that play key roles in the activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway and are often upregulated in a variety of tumor cell types.

Neratinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is a monoclonal antibody, called trastuzumab, linked to a chemotherapy drug called DM1. Trastuzumab attaches to HER2 positive cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers DM1 to kill them. Giving neratinib, capecitabine, and trastuzumab emtansine together may be an effective treatment for breast cancer.",
            "detail_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: \r\nI. To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) in the central nervous system (CNS) by composite response criteria in Cohort 1, Cohort 3A, and Cohort 3B. \r\nII. To evaluate the ORR in the CNS by more modern criteria, namely the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Brain Metastases (RANO-BM) criteria, separately in Cohorts 4A, 4B, and 4C.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES: \r\nI. ORR in non-CNS sites (by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST 1.1] criteria). (All Cohorts)\r\nII. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). (All Cohorts)\r\nIII. CNS response by Macdonald criteria. (Cohort 1 only)\r\nIV. CNS response by volumetric/composite criteria. (Secondary endpoint for Cohorts 4A-4C only as this is primary objective for Cohorts 1, 3A-3B)\r\nV. First site of disease progression. (All Cohorts)\r\nVI. Safety and tolerability of therapy. (All Cohorts)\r\nVII. Time to CNS radiation. (Cohort 4A only)\r\nVIII. Association of circulating tumor cell (CTC) count and OS. (Cohort 1 only)\r\nIX. Assess clinical outcomes for patients who opt to receive trastuzumab and neratinib at the time of non-CNS progression (i.e. toxicity, CNS and non-CNS response, site of first progression, OS). (Cohort 1 only)\r\n\r\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES: \r\nI. PFS and OS in patients who undergo craniotomy. (Cohort 2)\r\nII. PFS from the time of addition of capecitabine for Cohort 2 patients.\r\nIII. ORR in the CNS for lapatinib-naive patients versus (vs.) lapatinib-treated patients. (All Cohorts)\r\nIV. Explore the association of MET (hepatocyte growth factor receptor) and HER2 co-amplification (in CTCs) with treatment response. (Cohorts 1, 3A/3B)\r\nV. Explore the relationship between the HER2 status of a patient’s primary breast cancer, metastatic lesions, and CTCs using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for HER2 gene amplification. (Cohorts 1, 3A/3B)\r\nVI. Explore the possible mechanisms of resistance driven by Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) using FISH for EGFR gene amplification in HER2-positive CTCs. (Cohorts 1, 3A/3B)\r\nVII. Assess neratinib concentrations and concentrations of its metabolites in CNS tumor, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma at craniotomy in patients who receive neratinib prior to surgery. (Cohort 2)\r\nVIII. Examine neurocognitive function for patients with varying previous therapies for CNS disease. (Cohort 1)\r\nIX. Explore primary archival samples and metastatic samples when able to evaluate for predictors of response and outcome. (Cohorts 3A/3B)\r\nX. Perform molecular characterization of potential resistance mechanisms, predictive biomarkers, and immunological function by collecting blood and tumor specimens. (Cohort 3A/3B, 4A/4B/4C)\r\nXI. Examine changes in the mutational profiles of one’s disease using circulating tumor (ct) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (all Cohort 4 patients) in blood and in CSF (for any Cohort 4 patient undergoing lumbar puncture).\r\nXII. Evaluate patient-reported gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity and its impact on quality of life for patients receiving neratinib and trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1). (Cohort 4 patients only, cycles 1-3)\r\nXIII. Compare patient-reported and clinician-reported gastrointestinal adverse events during the first 3 cycles of T-DM1 and neratinib therapy. (Cohort 4 patients)\r\nXIV. Evaluate self-reported adherence using the Voils measure to anti-diarrheal prophylaxis during cycle 1 and anti-diarrheal medication diaries during T-DM1 and neratinib therapy. (All Cohort 4 patients)\r\nXV. Compare (exploratory endpoint) symptom reporting for Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and Systemic Therapy Induced Diarrhea Assessment Tool (STIDAT) measures for diarrhea. (Cohorts 4A-4C)\r\n\r\nOUTLINE:\r\nCOHORT I: Patients receive neratinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. \r\n\r\nCOHORT II: Patients receive neratinib PO QD for 7-21 days and then undergo craniotomy. Patients resume neratinib within 10 days post-operatively.\r\n\r\nCOHORTS IIIA/IIIB: Patients receive neratinib PO QD on days 1-21 and capecitabine PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-14. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nCOHORTS IVA-IVC: Patients receive neratinib PO QD on days 1-21 and trastuzumab emtansine intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nEXTENSION PHASE: Patients achieving CNS response or disease stability yet develop disease progression outside of the CNS receive trastuzumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes every 7 or 21 days. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. \r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up approximately every 6 months for up to 2 years.",

The device is an experimental, portable, battery operated device for chronic administration of alternating electric fields (termed TTFields or TTF) to the region of the malignant tumor, by means of surface, insulated electrode arrays.",
            "detail_description": "PAST PRE-CLINICAL AND CLINICAL EXPERIENCE:\r\n\r\n      The effect of the electric fields (TTFields, TTF) has demonstrated significant activity in in\r\n      vitro and in vivo NSCLC pre-clinical models both as a single modality treatment and in\r\n      combination with chemotherapies. TTFields have also shown to inhibit metastatic spread of\r\n      malignant melanoma in in vivo experiment.\r\n\r\n      In a pilot study, 42 patients with advanced NSCLC who had tumor progression after at least\r\n      one line of prior chemotherapy, received pemetrexed together with TTFields (150 kHz) applied\r\n      to the chest and upper abdomen until disease progression (Pless M., et al., Lung Cancer\r\n      2011). Efficacy endpoints were remarkably high compared to historical data for pemetrexed\r\n      alone.\r\n\r\n      In addition, a phase III trial of Optune® (200 kHz) as monotherapy compared to active\r\n      chemotherapy in recurrent glioblastoma patients showed TTFields to be equivalent to active\r\n      chemotherapy in extending survival, associated with minimal toxicity, good quality of life,\r\n      and activity within the brain (14% response rate) (Stupp R., et al., EJC 2012). Finally, a\r\n      phase III trial of Optune® combined with maintenance temozolomide compared to maintenance\r\n      temozolomide alone has shown that combined therapy led to a significant improvement in both\r\n      progression free survival and overall survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma\r\n      without the addition of high grade toxicity and without decline in quality of life (Stupp R.,\r\n      et al., JAMA 2015).\r\n\r\n      Applying TTFields at 150 kHz to the brain for the treatment of 1-5 brain metastasis from\r\n      NSCLC using the NovoTTF-100M device has been demonstrated to be safe in a pilot study, where\r\n      patients were randomized after local therapy of their brain metastasis by neurosurgery and/or\r\n      stereotactic radiosurgery to receive either NovoTTF-100M treatment or supportive care alone.\r\n      Eighteen (18) patients have been enrolled in the study. There have been no device-related\r\n      serious adverse events (SAE) reported to date (Brozova H., et al., Neuro Oncol 2016).\r\n\r\n      DESCRIPTION OF THE TRIAL:\r\n\r\n      All patients included in this trial are patients with 1-10 brain metastases from NSCLC which\r\n      are amenable to stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). In addition, all patients must meet all\r\n      eligibility criteria.\r\n\r\n      Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups:\r\n\r\n        1. Patients undergo SRS followed by TTFields using the NovoTTF-100M System\r\n\r\n        2. Patients undergo SRS alone and receive supportive care.\r\n\r\n      Patients in both arms of the study may receive systemic therapy for their NSCLC at the\r\n      discretion of their treating physician.\r\n\r\n      Patients will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio. Baseline tests will be performed in patients\r\n      enrolled in both arms. If assigned to the NovoTTF-100M group, the patients will be treated\r\n      continuously with the device until second intracranial progression.\r\n\r\n      On both arms, patients who recur anywhere in the brain will be offered one of the following\r\n      salvage treatments (according to local practice) including, but not limited to:\r\n\r\n        -  Surgery\r\n\r\n        -  Repeat SRS\r\n\r\n        -  Whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT)\r\n\r\n      Patients on the control arm will be offered to cross over to the NovoTTF-100M arm of the\r\n      study and receive TTFields after salvage therapy for second intracranial progression if the\r\n      investigator believes it is in the best interest of the patient and patient agrees.\r\n\r\n      SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND:\r\n\r\n      Electric fields exert forces on electric charges similar to the way a magnet exerts forces on\r\n      metallic particles within a magnetic field. These forces cause movement and rotation of\r\n      electrically charged biological building blocks, much like the alignment of metallic\r\n      particles seen along the lines of force radiating outwards from a magnet.\r\n\r\n      Electric fields can also cause muscles to twitch and if strong enough may heat tissues.\r\n      TTFields are alternating electric fields of low intensity. This means that they change their\r\n      direction repetitively many times a second. Since they change direction very rapidly (150\r\n      thousand times a second), they do not cause muscles to twitch, nor do they have any effects\r\n      on other electrically activated tissues in the body (brain, nerves and heart). Since the\r\n      intensities of TTFields in the body are very low, they do not cause heating.\r\n\r\n      The breakthrough finding made by Novocure was that finely tuned alternating fields of very\r\n      low intensity, now termed TTFields (Tumor Treating Fields), cause a significant slowing in\r\n      the growth of cancer cells. Due to the unique geometric shape of cancer cells when they are\r\n      multiplying, TTFields cause electrically-charged cellular components of these cells to change\r\n      their location within the dividing cell, disrupting their normal function and ultimately\r\n      leading to cell death.. In addition, cancer cells also contain miniature building blocks\r\n      which act as tiny motors in moving essential parts of the cells from place to place. TTFields\r\n      interfere with the normal orientation of these tiny motors related to other cellular\r\n      components since they are electrically-charged as well. As a result of these two effects,\r\n      tumor cell division is slowed, results in cellular death or reverses after continuous\r\n      exposure to TTFields.\r\n\r\n      Other cells in the body (normal healthy tissues) are affected much less than cancer cells\r\n      since they multiply at a much slower rate if at all. In addition TTFields can be directed to\r\n      a certain part of the body, leaving sensitive areas out of their reach. Finally, the\r\n      frequency of TTFields applied to each type of cancer is specific and may not damage normally\r\n      dividing cells in healthy tissues.\r\n\r\n      In conclusion, TTFields hold the promise of serving as a brand new treatment for brain\r\n      metastases from NSCLC with very few side effects.",

When a cancer has a PI3K pathway mutation, it sends signals to other cells in the body to encourage rapid growth, leading to the spread of cancer. PI3K mutations are common in many types of cancer, and they cause radiation therapy to be less effective. GDC-0084 reduces the activity of PI3K-related signaling. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving GDC-0084 with whole or partial brain radiation therapy may be an effective treatment for solid tumors brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases.",

To determine the safety and toxicity of concurrent paxalisib (GDC-0084) and radiation therapy to the brain in patients with solid tumor brain metastases and/or leptomeningeal metastases harboring PI3K pathway mutations.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To determine the local recurrence rate of brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases treated with concurrent GDC-0084 and radiation therapy to the brain in patients with solid tumor brain metastases harboring PI3K pathway mutations.\r\nII. To determine the intracranial progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with solid tumor brain metastases harboring PI3K pathway mutations.\r\nIII. To further assess the safety and toxicity of protocol therapy in the dose expansion cohort.\r\n\r\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\r\nI. To assess feasibility of isolating and evaluating pre-treatment and post-treatment cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers including: circulating tumor cells (CTC), cell free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (cfDNA), cytokines, and ribonucleic acid (RNA) and protein analysis of the CSF cellular component.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of GDC-0084.\r\n\r\nPatients receive GDC-0084 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21, and undergo undergo whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) or partial radiation brain therapy (PBRT) for 10 fractions over approximately 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, 9,and 12 months, and then every 3 months thereafter.",

Upon oral administration, AZD9291 covalently binds to and inhibits the activity of mutant forms of EGFR, including the T790M EGFR mutant, thereby preventing EGFR-mediated signaling. This may both induce cell death and inhibit tumor growth in EGFR-overexpressing tumor cells. EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase mutated in many tumor cell types, plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and tumor vascularization. AZD9291 preferentially inhibits mutated forms of EGFR including T790M, a secondarily-acquired resistance mutation, and may have enhanced anti-tumor effects in tumors with T790M-mediated resistance when compared to other EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. As this agent is selective towards mutant forms of EGFR, its toxicity profile may be reduced when compared to non-selective EGFR inhibitors which also inhibit wild-type EGF",

Upon oral administration, AZD9291 covalently binds to and inhibits the activity of mutant forms of EGFR, including the T790M EGFR mutant, thereby preventing EGFR-mediated signaling. This may both induce cell death and inhibit tumor growth in EGFR-overexpressing tumor cells. EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase mutated in many tumor cell types, plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and tumor vascularization. AZD9291 preferentially inhibits mutated forms of EGFR including T790M, a secondarily-acquired resistance mutation, and may have enhanced anti-tumor effects in tumors with T790M-mediated resistance when compared to other EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. As this agent is selective towards mutant forms of EGFR, its toxicity profile may be reduced when compared to non-selective EGFR inhibitors which also inhibit wild-type EGF",

            "brief_summary": "This phase III trial compares the effect of adding whole brain radiotherapy with hippocampal avoidance and memantine to stereotactic radiosurgery versus stereotactic radiosurgery alone in treating patients with cancer that has spread to the brain and come back in other areas of the brain after earlier stereotactic radiosurgery. Hippocampus avoidance during whole-brain radiation therapy decreases the amount of radiation that is delivered to the hippocampus, which is a brain structure that is important for memory. The medicine memantine is also often given with whole brain radiation therapy because it may decrease the risk of side effects of radiation on neurocognitive function (including thinking and memory). Stereotactic radiosurgery delivers a high dose of radiation only to the small areas of cancer in the brain and avoids the surrounding normal brain tissue. Adding whole brain radiotherapy with hippocampal avoidance and memantine to stereotactic radiosurgery may be effective in reducing the size of the cancer or keeping the cancer the same size when it has spread to the brain and / or come back in other areas of the brain following stereotactic radiosurgery.",
            "detail_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\r\nI. To determine if salvage stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) plus whole brain radiotherapy with hippocampal avoidance (HA-WBRT) in patients with brain metastasis velocity >= 4 new brain metastases/year at time of first or second distant brain failure following upfront SRS prolongs time to neurologic death as compared to salvage SRS alone.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To determine if salvage SRS + HA-WBRT in patients with brain metastasis velocity >= 4 new brain metastases/year at time of first or second distant brain failure following upfront SRS prolongs overall survival as compared to salvage SRS alone.\r\nII. To evaluate if salvage SRS + HA-WBRT in patients with brain metastasis velocity >= 4 new brain metastases/year at time of first or second distant brain failure following upfront SRS prolongs intracranial progression-free survival as compared to salvage SRS alone.\r\nIII. To evaluate if salvage SRS + HA-WBRT in patients with brain metastasis velocity >= 4 new brain metastases/year at time of first or second distant brain failure following upfront SRS improves brain metastasis velocity at subsequent relapse as compared to salvage SRS alone.\r\nIV. To assess perceived difficulties in cognitive abilities, symptom burden and health status after salvage SRS + HA-WBRT, as compared to salvage SRS alone, in patients with brain metastasis velocity >= 4 new brain metastases/year at time of first or second distant brain failure following upfront SRS.\r\nV. To compare neurocognitive function outcomes following salvage SRS + HA-WBRT, as compared to salvage SRS alone, in patients with brain metastasis velocity >= 4 new brain metastases/year at time of first or second distant brain failure following upfront SRS.\r\nVI. To tabulate and descriptively compare the adverse events associated with the interventions.\r\nVII. To tabulate and descriptively compare the number of salvage procedures used to manage recurrent intracranial disease following the interventions.\r\n\r\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To collect serum, plasma, and whole blood for translational research analyses.\r\nII. To collect baseline and all follow-up magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for hippocampal volume, memory center substructures, axial T2 volumes, and quantitative texture analysis.\r\nIII. To collect baseline and follow-up MR imaging to extract whole brain volume, white matter volume and volume of metastatic disease to correlate with cognitive change at 4 months.\r\nIV. To evaluate dose-volume histogram parameters to correlate with radiation toxicity.\r\nV. To assess in patients receiving immunotherapy or targeted therapy, if salvage SRS + HA-WBRT in patients with brain metastasis velocity >= 4 new brain metastases/year at time of first or second distant brain failure following upfront SRS improves brain metastasis velocity and/or overall survival at subsequent relapse as compared to salvage SRS.\r\nVI. To compare the estimated cost of brain-related therapies and quality-adjusted life years in patients who receive salvage SRS + HA-WBRT, as compared to salvage SRS alone, in patients with metastasis velocity >= 4 new brain metastases/year at time of first or second distant brain failure following upfront SRS.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\r\n\r\nARM I: Patients undergo HA-WBRT daily (5 times weekly) for 2 weeks for a total of 10 fractions in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 1 week prior to or following HA-WBRT, patients undergo salvage SRS. Prior to HA-WBRT or no later than the 4th treatment, patients also receive memantine orally (PO) once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) for 24 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nARM II: Patients undergo salvage SRS.\r\n\r\nPatients are followed up at 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months after the start of SRS and then every 6 month after month 12 and within 21 days after patient death.",

This study is intended to evaluate the potential effect of hepatic impairments on\n      the PK and safety of lorlatinib after daily administration of lorlatinib and to provide\n      dosing recommendation for patients with varied degree of hepatic impairment if possible.\n\n      Patients in the study will be assigned to different groups (A1, normal liver function,\n      control for group B; A2, normal liver function, control for group C; B, mild hepatic\n      impairment; C, moderate hepatic impairment; D, severe hepatic impairment) according to their\n      liver function. The enrollment of approximately 76 advanced cancer patients is anticipated in\n      this study in order to have 8 PK-evaluable patients in each of Groups A1, A2, B and C, and 6\n      PK-evaluable patients in Group D for final statistical analysis. Evaluable patients are those\n      who complete the planned PK sample collection on Cycle 2 Day 1 and have no lorlatinib dose\n      modification until completion of Cycle 2 Day 1 PK evaluation. Patients who are not evaluable\n      for PK will be replaced. Each patient will be treated with repeated oral once daily doses of\n      lorlatinib in 21-day cycles until disease progression, patient refusal, or unacceptable\n      toxicity occurs. The dose schedule may be modified as necessary for individual patients\n      according to tolerability.",

Upon administration, ALK/ROS1 inhibitor PF-06463922 binds to and inhibits both ALK and ROS1 kinases. The kinase inhibition leads to disruption of ALK- and ROS1-mediated signaling and eventually inhibits tumor cell growth in ALK- and ROS1-overexpressing tumor cells. In addition, PF-06463922 is able to cross the blood brain barrier. ALK belongs to the insulin receptor superfamily and plays an important role in nervous system development; ALK dysregulation and gene rearrangements are associated with a series of tumors. ROS1, overexpressed in certain cancer cells, plays a key role in cell growth and survival of cancer cells. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent.

Upon administration, ALK/ROS1 inhibitor PF-06463922 binds to and inhibits both ALK and ROS1 kinases. The kinase inhibition leads to disruption of ALK- and ROS1-mediated signaling and eventually inhibits tumor cell growth in ALK- and ROS1-overexpressing tumor cells. In addition, PF-06463922 is able to cross the blood brain barrier. ALK belongs to the insulin receptor superfamily and plays an important role in nervous system development; ALK dysregulation and gene rearrangements are associated with a series of tumors. ROS1, overexpressed in certain cancer cells, plays a key role in cell growth and survival of cancer cells. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent.

Ropidoxuridine may help whole brain radiation therapy work better by making cancer cells more sensitive to the radiation therapy.",
            "detail_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\r\nI. To conduct a phase 1 dose escalation trial in patients with brain metastases to determine the recommended phase -2 dose of ropidoxuridine (5-iodo-2-pyrimidinone-2'-deoxyribose [IPdR]) when administered alone orally once daily for 7 consecutive days and then concurrently with conventionally fractionated whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) for additional 21 days.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To observe and record anti-tumor activity to IPdR-mediated radiosensitization.\r\nII. To estimate 6 month intracranial progression-free survival (PFS) in brain metastasis cancer patients who receive daily oral IPdR x 28 days and WBRT.\r\nIII. To establish the pharmacokinetics of daily oral dosing of IPdR times 8 days.\r\nIV. To evaluate safety and tolerability of oral IPdR x 28 days and WBRT.\r\nV. To estimate the incidence of delayed neurological toxicity at 2, 4, and 6 months (+/-1 week) post-completion of WBRT (for patients without intracranial progression) including:\r\nVa. Delayed-recall through Hopkins Verbal Learning Test Revised (HVLT-R).\r\nVb. Quality of life as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain (FACT-BR).\r\n\r\nCORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To assess for biochemical evidence of IPdR effect in normal tissues (circulating granulocytes) by measuring %IUdR-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) cellular incorporation by flow cytometry and high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses as an exploratory biomarker for the following:\r\nIa. %IUdR-DNA tumor cell incorporation from day 8 extracranial tumor biopsies in brain metastasis cancer patients receiving RP2D doses of IPdR as an exploratory biomarker of tumor radiosensitization using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.\r\nIb. %IUdR-DNA cellular incorporation in patients’ circulating granulocytes taken weekly during the 28-day IPdR RP2D dose, on day 29, and week 8 as an exploratory biomarker of IPdR systemic toxicities to bone marrow as measured by serial complete blood count (CBC)/differential values.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of ropidoxuridine.\r\n\r\nPatients receive ropidoxuridine orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and undergo WBRT daily for not more than 5 days per week beginning on day 8 for a total of 15 fractions in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 6 months, every 3-4 months for 6 months, and every 6 months for 1 year.",

Whole-brain radiotherapy delivers radiation to the entire brain Stereotactic radiosurgery is a specialized radiation therapy that delivers a single, high dose of radiation directly to the tumor and may cause less damage to normal tissue. It is not yet known whether whole-brain radiotherapy or stereotactic radiosurgery works better in treating patients with 5-20 malignant tumors in the brain.",
            "detail_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\r\nI. To test the hypothesis that, among patients with 5-20 brain metastases, post-treatment quality of life is superior for those treated with stereotactic radiation compared to those treated with whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT).\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To compare the following other endpoints between patients treated with WBRT and those treated with stereotactic radiation: \r\nIa. All-cause mortality.\r\nIb. Death due to neurologic causes (defined as death due to progressive brain metastases on imaging associated with progressive neurologic symptomatology in the setting of systemic disease that has not progressed to a life-threatening nature).\r\nIc. Performance status.\r\nId. Incidence and time to detection of new brain metastases.\r\nIe. Incidence and time to local recurrence.\r\nIf. Incidence and time to development of radiation necrosis.\r\nIg. Incidence and time to development of leptomeningeal disease.\r\nIh. Incidence and time to progressive intracranial disease.\r\nIi. Incidence and time to salvage craniotomy\r\nIj. Incidence and time to additional radiotherapeutic treatments after the initial course (stereotactic or WBRT).\r\nIk. Incidence and time to the development of seizures.\r\nIl. Incidence and time to neurologic/neurocognitive decline.\r\nIm. Steroid use.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\r\n\r\nARM I: Patients undergo WBRT daily for 10 fractions. \r\n\r\nARM II: Patients with lesions < 2 cm in maximum diameter undergo stereotactic radiosurgery for 1 fraction. Patients with lesions > 2.5-3 cm undergo stereotactic radiosurgery for 5 fractions. \r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 weeks and then at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 months thereafter.",

Berzosertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving berzosertib together with radiation therapy may work better compared to standard of care treatment, including brain surgery and radiation therapy, in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, or neuroendocrine tumors.",

To conduct a phase 1 dose escalation trial in patients with brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of twice weekly intravenous (i.v.) M6620 (VX-970) administered concurrent with conventionally fractionated whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), with M6620 (VX-970) starting 18-30 hours after the first dose of radiation (but prior to the second fraction of radiation).\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To estimate the incidence of >= grade 3 delayed neurological toxicity at 2, 4 and 6-months post-completion of whole-brain radiotherapy (for patients without intracranial progression).\r\nII. To observe and record anti-tumor activity.  \r\nIIa. To estimate the radiological response rates (RR) at 6 months including bi-directional and volumetric measurements of lesion size.\r\nIIb. To estimate the intracranial 6-month progression-free survival (PFS).\r\n\r\nEXPLORATORY/HYPOTHESIS GENERATING OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. Changes in dynamic susceptibility contrast enhancement (DSC-magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) perfusion and mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements in diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI). (Group I)\r\nII. To measure cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) M6620 (VX-970) levels, tumor M6620 (VX-970) levels, and pATR T1989, pCHK1 S345 and RAD51 multiplex foci. (Group II)\r\nIII. Changes in DSC-MRI perfusion and mean ADC measurements in DWI. (Group II)\r\n\r\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of berzosertib. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.\r\n\r\nGROUP I: Patients undergo whole-brain radiation therapy once daily (QD), 5 days a week for 15 fractions. Patients also receive berzosertib intravenously (IV) over 60-90 minutes twice a week, 18-30 hours after first radiation therapy. Treatment continues for 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nGROUP II: Patients receive berzosertib IV over 60-90 minutes 2-4 hours prior to surgery. After surgery, patients undergo whole-brain radiation therapy and receive berzosertib as in Group I.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 6 months, every 3-4 months for 6 months, then every 6 months for 1 year.",

This prevents DNA damage checkpoint activation, disrupts DNA damage repair, and induces tumor cell apoptosis. In addition, VX-970 sensitizes tumor cells to chemo- and radiotherapy. ATR, a serine/threonine protein kinase upregulated in a variety of cancer cell types, plays a key role in DNA repair, cell cycle progression, and survival; it is activated by DNA damage caused during DNA replication-associated stress.

ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 selectively inhibits ATR kinase activity and prevents ATR-mediated signaling in the ATR-checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) signaling pathway. This prevents DNA damage checkpoint activation, disrupts DNA damage repair, and induces tumor cell apoptosis. In addition, VX-970 sensitizes tumor cells to chemo- and radiotherapy. ATR, a serine/threonine protein kinase upregulated in a variety of cancer cell types, plays a key role in DNA repair, cell cycle progression, and survival; it is activated by DNA damage caused during DNA replication-associated stress.

To test the hypothesis that, among patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) or small cell cancer of any primary and 1-10 brain metastases, use of stereotactic radiation will not result in a worse rate of neurologic death than historical controls managed with whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT).\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. All-cause mortality.\r\nII. Quality of life.\r\nIII. Neurocognitive function.\r\nIV. Ability to complete activities of daily living.\r\nV. Performance status.\r\nVI. Incidence and time to detection of new brain metastases.\r\nVII. Incidence and time to local recurrence of existing brain metastases.\r\nVIII. Incidence and time to development of radiation necrosis.\r\nIX. Incidence and time to development of leptomeningeal disease.\r\nX. Incidence and time to progressive intracranial disease.\r\nXI. Incidence and time to salvage craniotomy.\r\nXII. Incidence and time to additional central nervous system (CNS)-directed radiotherapeutic treatments (stereotactic or WBRT) after the initial course.\r\nXIII. Incidence and time to the development of seizures.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE:\r\nPatients with lesions < 3 cm in maximum diameter undergo 1 fraction of stereotactic radiosurgery over 30-60 minutes, and patients with lesions > 3 cm in maximum diameter undergo stereotactic radiosurgery over 30-60 minutes once daily on days 1-5 for 5 fractions.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2-3 months.",

Frameless fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery is a specialized radiation therapy that delivers 3 to 5, high dose fractions of radiation directly to the brain lesions while sparing normal tissues.",
            "detail_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To assess the efficacy and safety of frameless fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (FFSRT) on the treatment of solitary and oligometastatic brain metastases in the MD Anderson Houston Area Locations, MD Anderson Radiation Treatment Centers in New Mexico, MD Anderson affiliates and the main campus of MD Anderson, for patients unable or unwilling to undergo frame-based stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To assess 6-month local control, intracranial progression-free survival and overall survival.\r\nII. To collect data on charges and reimbursements of patients treated with FFSRT to compare those charges and reimbursements if the same patients had been treated with single-fraction, frame-based gamma knife SRS.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE:\r\nPatients undergo FFSRT daily over 30 minutes for 3-5 days.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 1 year.",

Stereotactic radiosurgery is a specialized radiation therapy that delivers a single, high dose of radiation directly to the tumor and may cause less damage to normal tissue. Abemaciclib, ribociclib, and palbociclib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving abemaciclib, ribociclib, or palbociclib concurrently with stereotactic radiosurgery may reduce the side effects and / or increase the response to each of the therapies.",

Prospectively evaluate safety and toxicity of the combination of radiosurgery (SRS) and concurrent CDK 4/6 inhibitors (CDKi) for hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer patients.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. Evaluate late toxicity (after 3 months) following SRS and concurrent CDKi.\r\nII. Evaluate local control efficacy with combination therapy of SRS and concurrent CDKi.\r\nIII. Assess quality of life and neurologic functional outcomes following treatment using standardized questionnaire (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain [FACT-Br]).\r\nIV. Analyze overall survival.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 groups.\r\n\r\nGROUP I: Beginning within 2 weeks prior to stereotactic radiosurgery, patients receive abemaciclib orally (PO) twice daily (BID). Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nGROUP II: Beginning within 2 weeks prior to stereotactic radiosurgery, patients receive ribociclib PO once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nGROUP III: Beginning within 2 weeks prior to stereotactic radiosurgery, patients receive palbociclib PO QD on days 1-21. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, 4-6 weeks post stereotactic radiosurgery, and then every 3 months for up to 1 year.",

CDK4/6 dual inhibitor LY2835219 specifically inhibits CDK4 and 6, thereby inhibiting retinoblastoma (Rb) protein phosphorylation in early G1. Inhibition of Rb phosphorylation prevents CDK-mediated G1-S phase transition, thereby arresting the cell cycle in the G1 phase, suppressing DNA synthesis and inhibiting cancer cell growth. Overexpression of the serine/threonine kinases CDK4/6, as seen in certain types of cancer, causes cell cycle deregulation. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent.

Palbociclib selectively inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and 6 (CDK6), thereby inhibiting retinoblastoma (Rb) protein phosphorylation early in the G1 phase leading to cell cycle arrest. This suppresses DNA replication and decreases tumor cell proliferation. CDK4 and 6 are serine/threonine kinases that are upregulated in many tumor cell types and play a key role in the regulation of cell cycle progression.

CDK4/6 inhibitor LEE011 specifically inhibits CDK4 and 6, thereby inhibiting retinoblastoma (Rb) protein phosphorylation. Inhibition of Rb phosphorylation prevents CDK-mediated G1-S phase transition, thereby arresting the cell cycle in the G1 phase, suppressing DNA synthesis and inhibiting cancer cell growth. Overexpression of CDK4/6, as seen in certain types of cancer, causes cell cycle deregulation. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent.

            "brief_summary": "This phase II trial studies the effect of infliximab or corticosteroids (methylprednisolone and prednisone or prednisone alone) in treating patients with inflammation of the intestines (colitis) caused by taking ipilimumab. Infliximab is a type of drug that targets a protein called TNF-alpha. This protein is responsible for regulating the inflammatory response in the body. In diseases such as colitis, there is too much of the TNF-alpha protein which causes certain parts of the body to become inflamed. The excess TNF-alpha protein is causing inflammation in the intestines, resulting in colitis. Infliximab is thought to inhibit (stop) the TNF-alpha protein from working correctly which results in the prevention of the inflammation in the intestines causing colitis. Both methylprednisolone and prednisone are corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory drugs, and it is believed that they help with the inflammation that causes colitis. Giving infliximab or corticosteroids may reduce inflammation and help fight against colitis caused by ipilimumab.",
            "detail_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\r\nI. Compare the rates of steroid-free ipilimumab-related colitis remission at seven weeks, defined as less than 7.5 mg of prednisone per day or equivalent and grade-1 or lower colitis- associated symptoms, for infliximab compared to systemic corticosteroids.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. Determine the safety of infliximab compared to systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of ipilimumab colitis.\r\nII. Determine the need for secondary immune suppression in patients with ipilimumab colitis treated with infliximab compared to systemic corticosteroids.\r\nIII. Determine the time to steroid-free ipilimumab colitis remission defined as less than 7.5 mg prednisone per day or equivalent and grade 1 or lower symptoms for infliximab compared to systemic corticosteroids.\r\nIV. Determine rates of symptom remission at 72 hours and also 4 weeks after start of infliximab or systemic corticosteroids.\r\nV. Determine the effect of infliximab compared to systemic corticosteroids on the composite endpoint of ipilimumab colitis-specific mortality or the need for colectomy.\r\nVI. Determine cumulative steroid exposure (dose x duration) in patients with ipilimumab colitis treated with infliximab compared to systemic corticosteroids.\r\nVII. Compare the progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and objective response rate (ORR) in patients with ipilimumab colitis treated with infliximab compared to systemic corticosteroids.\r\n\r\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. Define the immunologic microenvironment in colonic tissue and blood from patients with ipilimumab colitis and track the response to treatment.\r\nII. Assess changes in circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA) levels in patients with ipilimumab colitis following treatment with infliximab or systemic corticosteroids.\r\nIII. Determine the features of the microbiome associated with ipilimumab colitis and response to infliximab and systemic corticosteroid treatment.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\r\n\r\nARM I: Patients receive infliximab intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on day 1. Patients who do not have complete symptomatic resolution (grade 1 or less) within 1 week or who develop recurrent symptoms may receive additional doses of infliximab on days 15 and 43 per physician discretion.\r\n\r\nARM II: Inpatients receive methylprednisolone IV over 30 minutes twice daily (BID) on day 1 until symptoms resolve and then receive prednisone orally (PO) once daily (QD) for up to 7 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Outpatients receive prednisone PO QD for up to 7 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days and then every 3-6 months for up to 3 years.",

CB-839 HCl and sapanisertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.",
            "detail_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\r\nI. To determine the safety and tolerability of glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 hydrochloride (CB-839 HCl) (telaglenastat) in combination with MLN0128 (sapanisertib) and determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the combination.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To observe and record anti-tumor activity.\r\nII. To examine preliminary efficacy of CB-839 HCl (telaglenastat) and MLN0128 (sapanisertib) in squamous cell lung cancers (LSCC) and in select, molecularly-defined non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cohorts.\r\nIIa. To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and disease control rate (DCR) of patients treated with CB-839 HCl (telaglenastat) and MLN0128 (sapanisertib).\r\n\r\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To correlate genomic and metabolomic signatures with response.\r\nII. To evaluate metabolic response (18Glutamine [GLN]-positron emission tomography [PET]/computed tomography [CT]; 18Fluorodeoxyglucose [FDG]-PET/CT) in NSCLC tumors treated with CB-839 HCl (telaglenastat) and MLN0128 (sapanisertib) in the dose expansion.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 hydrochloride.\r\n\r\nPatients receive glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and sapanisertib PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up quarterly.",

HER2 and ER are two types of proteins called receptors that can affect the growth of breast cancer cells. Additionally, investigators hope to learn from this study if tumor genetic information is important for predicting whether this type of breast cancer will respond to fulvestrant and copanlisib. Copanlisib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Hormone therapy using fulvestrant may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells. Giving copanlisib and fulvestrant may work better in treating patients with ER+ and HER2- breast cancer compared to fulvestrant alone.",

Evaluate the response rate (RR) of the combination of copanlisib and fulvestrant in patients with estrogen-receptor positive (ER+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative metastatic breast cancer that has previously progressed on aromatase inhibitor (AI)/cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor therapy.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. Estimate progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with copanlisib and fulvestrant stratifying by actionable PIK3CA mutation, actionable PIK3CA or PTEN mutation, or wild type PIK3CA and PTEN.\r\nII. Estimate the RR in subjects with PTEN loss by immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis performed retrospectively.\r\nIII. Evaluate toxicity in patients treated with FC in Phase II.\r\n\r\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. Evaluate copanlisib pharmacokinetics (PK) when given in combination with fulvestrant.\r\nII. Explore association between intrinsic subtype and response to FC therapy.\r\nIII. Assess baseline levels and treatment-induced proteomic changes and correlate with response to FC.\r\nIV. Evaluate circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA) mutations at baseline and over time for response predictors at baseline, clonal evolution associated with treatment, and resistance mechanisms at disease progression.\r\nV. Evaluate PFS in patients with baseline ctDNA PIK3CA actionable mutations versus (vs.) those with wild type PK3CA.\r\nVI. To evaluate genomic and gene expression changes in tumor cells and in associated tumor microenvironment before and after administration of copanlisib in combination with fulvestrant and at the time of progression. \r\nVII. Evaluate circulating markers of metabolism before and after PI3K inhibitor therapy which may predict treatment response and resistance mechanisms.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE:\r\nPatients receive copanlisib intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and fulvestrant intramuscularly (IM) over 1-2 minutes on days 1 and 15 of cycle 1 and on day 1 beginning cycle 2. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.",

            "brief_summary": "This phase III trial studies the side effects and how well stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) works before or after surgery in patients with tumors that has spread to the brain or that can be removed by surgery. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a specialized radiation therapy that delivers a single, high dose of radiation directly to the tumor and may cause less damage to normal tissue.",
            "detail_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\r\nI. To determine for patients with brain metastases meeting the inclusion criteria, whether there is an increase in the time to a composite endpoint of adverse outcomes including the first occurrence of either: local recurrence, leptomeningeal disease, or symptomatic radiation brain necrosis in patients who receive SRS prior to surgery as compared to patients who receive surgery prior to SRS.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To determine for patients with brain metastases whether there is improved overall survival for patients who receive SRS prior to surgery as compared to patients who receive SRS after surgery.\r\nII. To determine for patients with brain metastases whether there are improved patient reported outcomes including quality of life for patients who receive SRS prior to surgery as compared to patients who receive SRS after surgery.\r\nIII. To determine if preoperative SRS increases rates of surgical morbidity including postoperative complications such as wound infection, need for longer hospital stays, or readmission compared to a surgery first approach for resectable brain metastases.\r\nIV. To determine for patients with brain metastases whether there is a higher rate of completion of planned therapies for patients who receive SRS prior to surgery as compared to patients who receive surgery prior to SRS.\r\nV. To determine for patients with brain metastases whether there is a shorter time to initiation or re-initiation of systemic therapy with pre-operative versus post-operative SRS. \r\nVI. To determine for patients treated with pre-operative SRS whether there is a longer interval to regional progression, any central nervous system (CNS) progression or need for subsequent intracranial treatment compared to patients receiving post-operative SRS.\r\nVII. To determine for patients with pre-operative as compared to post-operative radiation whether there is a decreased rate of radiation necrosis, including asymptomatic and symptomatic radiation necrosis.\r\nVIII. To determine for patients with pre-operative as compared to post-operative radiation whether there is a decreased rate of local recurrence.\r\nIX. To determine for patients with pre-operative as compared to post-operative radiation whether there is a decreased rate of leptomeningeal disease.\r\n\r\nCORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To determine the genetic and molecular alterations of brain metastases seen after radiation versus in the setting of resection alone, including early radiobiologic changes in tissue treated with SRS 24 to 48 hours prior, and to investigate detection rate of corresponding circulating deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and/or inflammatory markers in peripheral specimens.\r\nII. To investigate the usefulness of biomarkers and response to radiation in predicting local control and outcomes.\r\nIII. To look at cell capture of tumor cells as well as cell free DNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampled at the time of surgery, comparing patients receiving neoadjuvant treatment to those that have not.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\r\n\r\nARM A: Patients undergo surgery on day 1. Within 2 weeks, patients undergo stereotactic radiosurgery.\r\n\r\nARM B: Patients undergo stereotactic radiosurgery on day 1. Within 4 weeks, patients undergo surgery.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 weeks, every 3-4 months for up to 2 years and then periodically for up to 3 years.",

To determine the safety and tolerability and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of leflunomide in women with previously treated metastatic triple negative breast cancer. (Phase I)\r\nII. To determine the efficacy of leflunomide in patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) PTEN null (30-50% of TNBC) and patients with PTEN wild type. (Phase II)\r\nIII. To evaluate the clinical benefit rate (CBR) (complete response [CR]+partial response [PR]+stable disease [SD]) in women with metastatic TNBC, in two cohorts, one PTEN null, and the other PTEN wild type. (Phase II)\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To describe the adverse events associated with oral leflunomide. (Phase I)\r\nII. To describe the adverse events associated with oral leflunomide. (Phase II)\r\nIII. To measure the objective response rate in those with measurable disease. (Phase II)\r\nIV. To measure the progression free survival (PFS) in the two cohorts of PTEN wild and null TNBC. (Phase II)\r\n\r\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To determine PTEN protein expression.\r\nII. To measure expression of gamma-H2X in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) (express increased in PTEN null tumors relative to PTEN wild-type after treatment with leflunomide.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.\r\n\r\nPatients receive leflunomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.",

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body’s immune system attack the cancer, may induce changes in body’s immune system, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Pertuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Trastuzumab is a form of “targeted therapy” because it works by attaching itself to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as HER2 receptors. When trastuzumab attaches to HER2 receptors, the signals that tell the cells to grow are blocked and the cancer cell may be marked for destruction by the body’s immune system. Giving atezolizumab, pertuzumab, and trastuzumab may work better in treating patients with breast cancer compared to pertuzumab and trastuzumab.",

To collect blood to study cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for quantification of tumor DNA content and copy number variation, using ultra-low pass whole genome sequencing, and to explore whether cell-free DNA (cfDNA) load is associated with patient outcomes (PFS, CNS ORR, CBR, and OS).\r\nIII. To collect blood to study cell-free DNA for targeted sequencing and/or whole exome sequencing to compare mutations and copy number variation between cfDNA and tumor biopsies.\r\nIV. To characterize a broad array of immune markers in metastatic HER-2 positive breast cancer (characterization will be based on histology, protein expression, and messenger ribonucleic acid [mRNA] expression), and their changes with immune checkpoint blockade.\r\nV. To explore how different immunosuppressive and/or immune-stimulating immune marker profiles at baseline correlate with patient outcomes (PFS, CNS ORR, CBR and OS).\r\nVI. To characterize changes in immune marker profiles on treatment and at time of progression.\r\nVII. To characterize serial changes in immune marker profile in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and in plasma over the course of the trial treatment.\r\nVIII.

To explore whether cfDNA load in CSF is associated with clinical outcomes (PFS, CNS ORR, complete response rate [CRR], and OS).\r\nXI. To collect CSF to study cell-free DNA for targeted sequencing and/or whole exome sequencing before, on and after immunotherapy. To compare mutations and copy number variation between cfDNA in plasma versus CSF.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE:\r\nPatients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day 1, pertuzumab IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1, and trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycles 1-8 and day 1 of subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6-12 weeks or 6 months thereafter.",

Anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody MPDL3280A binds to PD-L1, blocking its binding to and activation of its receptor, PD-1 (programmed death 1), which may enhance the T-cell-mediated immune response to neoplasms and reverse T-cell inactivation. In addition, by binding to PD-L1, MPDL3280A also prevents binding of this ligand to B7.1. PD-L1 is overexpressed on many human cancer cell types. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on T-cells suppresses the immune system and results in increased immune evasion. PD-1, a transmembrane protein expressed on activated T-cells, is a negative regulator of the immune system that limits the expansion and survival of CD8+ T cells. The Fc region of MPDL3280A is modified in such a way that it does not induce either antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) or complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC)",
