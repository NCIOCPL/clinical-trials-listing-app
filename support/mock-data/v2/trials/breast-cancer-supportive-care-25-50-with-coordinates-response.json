Lung cancer and breast cancer are the two most frequent causes of brain metastases. The diagnosis of brain metastases is associated with poorer survival and tumor-induced and treatment-related side effects. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a type of external radiation therapy that uses special equipment to position the patient and precisely give a single large dose of radiation to a tumor. Patients who receive stereotactic radiosurgery for brain metastases may experience less neurocognitive side effects than with other types of brain radiation, but may still be at risk for their brain metastases growing, spreading, or getting worse. Patients with obesity and diabetes have been shown to have worse survival and increased radiation-related side effects. Evidence demonstrates that simply changing meal timing can have a positive impact on multiple health outcomes. Time-restricted eating, or prolonged nighttime fasting, has been proven to have positive effects on heart disease risk reduction, weight control management and chemotherapy side effect reduction.
