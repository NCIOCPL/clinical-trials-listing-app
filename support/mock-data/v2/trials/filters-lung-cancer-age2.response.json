It is found inside\r\n     the nucleus of the cell and consists of a complex of DNA and protein.\r\n\r\n  -  Cancers of the lung, pleura (lung lining) and esophagus show profound changes in\r\n     chromatin structure that may affect the course of disease in patients.\r\n\r\n  -  A better understanding of these diseases and the genetic changes associated with\r\n     them may be helpful in developing new treatments for them.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\n\r\n  -  To evaluate people with cancer of the lung, pleura or esophagus for participation in\r\n     NCI clinical trials.\r\n\r\n  -  To obtain biopsies (small pieces of tissue) from tumor, normal tissue and blood\r\n     samples to learn more about the cellular changes in blood and tissue in tumors of\r\n     the lung, esophagus and pleura and surrounding structures in the chest.\r\n\r\nEligibility: Patients 2 years of age and older with cancer of the lung, esophagus,\r\npleura, mediastinum or chest wall, or cancers of other origin that have invaded the lung.\r\nNote: Patients >= 2 years of age and under 18 years of age may only participate in\r\nresearch sample collection.\r\n\r\nDesign:\r\n\r\n  -  Up to 1310 patients may be included in this study.\r\n\r\n  -  Patients undergo standard tests for evaluating the stage of their disease and for\r\n     determining eligibility for an NCI investigational treatment study.\r\n\r\n  -  All patients undergo bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (\"washing\" with salt\r\n     water) to assess their tumor and collect a sample of normal tissue. Patients whose\r\n     tumor is located on the outside portion of the lung may also undergo thoracoscopy to\r\n     obtain a tumor sample. For bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage a tube with a\r\n     light is passed through the nose or mouth into the lungs to examine the airways.\r\n     Salt water is injected through the tube and then withdrawn to obtain cells for\r\n     laboratory studies. For the thoracoscopy a small tube with a light is put through a\r\n     small hole in the chest to obtain the tumor sample. Both procedures are usually done\r\n     under general anesthesia. The tissue is examined to identify cell characteristics of\r\n     people who respond to certain therapies and to identify markers on the surface of\r\n     the tissue that may be useful in future research and treatment.\r\n\r\n  -  Blood and urine samples are collected from patients.\r\n\r\n  -  Patients who are eligible for a treatment study at NCI are offered participation in\r\n     the study.\r\n\r\n  -  Patients for whom standard surgery, radiation or chemotherapy is more appropriate\r\n     may receive treatment at NCI or with their own physician.\r\n\r\n  -  Patients who receive treatment at NCI return for follow-up examinations 4 weeks\r\n     after discharge and then every 2 to 4 months depending on the nature of their\r\n     cancer.", "nct_id": "NCT00242723", "brief_title": "Evaluation of Cell Changes in Blood and Tissue in Cancers of the Lung, Esophagus and Lung Lining", "sites": [{"org_state_or_province": "MD", "org_city": "Bethesda", "org_country": "United States", "org_name": "National Institutes of Health Clinical Center", "org_coordinates": {"lon": -77.1056, "lat": 39.0003}, "recruitment_status": "ACTIVE"}], "nci_id": "NCI-2018-02209"}, {"current_trial_status": "Active", "brief_summary": "The purpose of this multi-national disease registry is to collect prospectively (with\r\nlongitudinal follow-up) high-quality, standardized, and contemporaneous data to capture\r\nchanges in the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment landscape and outcomes over\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe registry will capture data on participants; demographic, clinical characteristics\r\n(including biomarker data), treatment patterns, and effectiveness and safety outcomes for\r\nadvanced NSCLC with mesenchymal-epithelial transition exon 14 (METex14) participants\r\ntreated with systemic therapy.", "nct_id": "NCT05376891", "brief_title": "Met Non Small Cell Cancer Registry (MOMENT)", "sites": [{"org_state_or_province": "OH", "org_city": "Columbus", "org_country": "United States", "org_name": "Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center", "org_coordinates": {"lon": -83.0218, "lat": 40.0051}, "recruitment_status": "ACTIVE"}], "nci_id": "NCI-2023-10202"}, {"current_trial_status": "Active", "brief_summary": "This study uses therapeutic target -focused profiling, genome-wide profiling of a type of RNA found in cells that carries the genetic information needed to make proteins, called messenger RNA, and assessments of tumor marker (phosphopeptides) and DNA that are shed into the blood stream to define how various molecular factors alone and in combination relate to resistance to therapy, to prognosis, and to patterns of cancer that has come back (relapse) and spread to other places in the body (metastatic).", "nct_id": "NCT05049837", "brief_title": "Profiling of Resistance Patterns & Oncogenic Signaling Pathways in Evaluation of Cancers of the Thorax and Therapeutic Target Identification, PROSPECT Study", "sites": [{"org_state_or_province": "TX", "org_city": "Houston", "org_country": "United States", "org_name": "M D Anderson Cancer Center", "org_coordinates": {"lon": -95.4026, "lat": 29.7059}, "recruitment_status": "ACTIVE"}], "nci_id": "NCI-2021-09810"}, {"current_trial_status": "Active", "brief_summary": "Background:\r\n\r\n  -  Malignant mesothelioma is a malignancy arising from the mesothelial cells of the\r\n     pleura, peritoneum, pericardium, or tunica vaginalis.\r\n\r\n  -  Mesothelioma accounts for 0.10% of deaths annually in the United States.
