Trastuzumab emtansine is a monoclonal antibody, called trastuzumab, linked to a chemotherapy drug called emtansine. Trastuzumab attaches to HER2 positive cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers emtansine to kill them. Chemotherapy drugs, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody, which are disease-fighting proteins made by cloned immune cells. Giving trastuzumab emtansine followed by trastuzumab may have less side-effects than traditional HER2-positive breast cancer treatment of trastuzumab and paclitaxel.",

Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Pertuzumab and trastuzumab are called targeted therapies because they work by attaching themselves to specific receptors on the surface of breast tumor cells, known as HER2 receptors. HER2 receptors can be found on normal cells, but can also be found in larger numbers on some tumor cells. When these targeted therapies attach to HER2 receptors, cell growth signals within the cell are blocked and the tumor cell may be marked for destruction by the immune system. This process allows pertuzumab and trastuzumab to help slow or stop the growth of breast cancer. Pertuzumab and trastuzumab target different areas on the HER2 receptor, so they are believed to work together more effectively when combined after radiation therapy.

Trastuzumab is an antibody like the antibodies made by the immune system to protect the body from infections, cancer, and other potential harms. Trastuzumab has been designed to target and kill cancer cells that express HER2.

Blocking this protein strengthens the immune system, which may help the immune system target and fight cancer cells.

Trastuzumab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches itself to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as HER2 receptors. When trastuzumab attaches to HER2 receptors, the signals that tell the cells to grow are blocked and the cancer cell may be marked for destruction by the body's immune system. Colony-stimulating factors, such as sargramostim, may increase the production of blood cells and may help the immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy. Giving trastuzumab with sargramostim may work better in treating younger patients with recurrent ependymoma.",
