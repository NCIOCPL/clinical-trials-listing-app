Standard of care treatment consists of whole brain radiation therapy, which targets the entire brain, and may result in side effects affecting the nervous system. Stereotactic radiosurgery only targets areas of the brain that are suspected to be affected by the disease. The purpose of this trial is to learn if and how patients’ brain functions are affected by the use of stereotactic radiosurgery rather than whole brain radiation therapy in managing brain metastasis caused by small cell lung cancer. Stereotactic radiosurgery may help patients avoid nervous system side effects caused by whole brain radiation therapy.",

Frameless SRS uses a plastic mask that is customized to fit the face for very accurate targeting of brain tumors. The results of this study may help researchers to determine whether multiple SRS treatments may decrease the risk for complications associated with a single SRS treatment.",

			"brief_summary": "Background: Drugs known as PARP inhibitors are known to help stop tumor growth in patients with breast, ovarian cancers and many other cancers including prostate and pancreatic cancers. Many research studies done in animals and human cells have shown that these type of drugs can improve how well chemotherapy works. Standard chemotherapy can be too toxic to be combined with PARP inhibitors. In this study, we use a new form of chemotherapy called PLX038 to see if it can be safely combined with PARP inhibitors to shrink tumors. Objective: To find a safe combination of PLX038 and rucaparib, and to see if this mix will cause tumors to shrink. Eligibility: People age 18 and older with solid tumors, SCLC, or small cell cancer outside their lungs. Design: Participants will be screened with: Physical exam Blood tests Records of their diagnosis (or they will have a tumor biopsy) A review of their symptoms and medications A review of their ability to perform their normal activities Electrocardiograms to measure the electrical activity of the heart Computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. CT scans are a series of X-rays. Participants will get PLX038 by intravenous catheter on Day 1 of each cycle (1 cycle = 21 days). For this, a small plastic tube is put into an arm vein. They will take rucaparib twice daily by mouth on Days 3 to 19 of each cycle. They will keep a medicine diary. Participants may give a hair sample. They may have optional tumor biopsies. Screening tests are repeated throughout the study. About 30 days after treatment ends, participants will have a safety follow-up visit. They will give blood samples, talk about their health, and get a physical exam. Then they will be called or emailed every 6 months....",

Adavosertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. PARPs are proteins that help repair DNA mutations. PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, can keep PARP from working, so tumor cells can't repair themselves, and they may stop growing. Giving olaparib and adavosertib one after the other may shrink or stabilize advanced solid tumors as successfully as using them together, with fewer side effects.",
