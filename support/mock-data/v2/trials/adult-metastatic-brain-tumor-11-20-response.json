When a cancer has a PI3K pathway mutation, it sends signals to other cells in the body to encourage rapid growth, leading to the spread of cancer. PI3K mutations are common in many types of cancer, and they cause radiation therapy to be less effective. GDC-0084 reduces the activity of PI3K-related signaling. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving GDC-0084 with whole or partial brain radiation therapy may be an effective treatment for solid tumors brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases.",
