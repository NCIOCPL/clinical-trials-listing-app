{"total": 1, "data": [{"current_trial_status": "Active", "brief_summary": "Trastuzumab is an important treatment for HER 2 positive breast cancer. But trastuzumab\r\ncan cause injury to the heart, and this is one of the main reasons it cannot be\r\nadministered as planned. Heart injury can often be successfully treated using cardiac\r\nmedications. The objectives of SCHOLAR-2 are to evaluate whether is it safe and effective\r\nto continue trastuzumab, pertuzumab or trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1) in patients with\r\nearly stage HER-2 positive breast cancer despite mild, minimally symptomatic or\r\nasymptomatic systolic left ventricular dysfunction as compared with a guideline-driven\r\napproach of withholding or discontinuing trastuzumab, pertuzumab or trastuzumab-emtansine\r\n(T-DM1).\r\n\r\nIn SCHOLAR-2, we will compare two thresholds of withholding or discontinuing\r\ntrastuzumab/pertuzumab/trastuzumab-emtansine: a threshold that is currently advocated for\r\nby existing treatment practice guidelines versus a more aggressive threshold that allows\r\ntrastuzumab/pertuzumab/trastuzumab-emtansine to continue at lower levels of LVEF than\r\ncurrently supported by guideline documents.", "nct_id": "NCT04680442", "brief_title": "Safety of Continuing HER-2 Directed Therapy in Overt Left Ventricular Dysfunction", "sites": [{"org_state_or_province": "CA", "org_city": "Los Angeles", "org_country": "United States", "org_name": "UCLA / Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center", "org_coordinates": {"lon": -118.4432, "lat": 34.071}, "recruitment_status": "ACTIVE"}], "nci_id": "NCI-2023-07497"}]}
