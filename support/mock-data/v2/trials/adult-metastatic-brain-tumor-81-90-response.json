			"brief_summary": "Background: EP0057 consists of a sugar molecule cyclodextrin linked to a chemotherapy drug called camptothecin. The combined molecule or \"nanoparticle drug conjugate\" travels through the blood. Once inside cancer cells, the chemotherapy drug is released from the molecule. Olaparib is a drug that may stop cancer cells from repairing the DNA damage caused by chemotherapy. Researchers want to see how safe it is to give EP0057 and olaparib together and to see how well the combination treats a specific type of lung cancer called small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Objectives: To test the safety and maximum dose of EP0057 and olaparib together. To test how well they treat small cell lung cancer. Eligibility: Adults 18 and older with small cell lung cancer. Design: Participants will be screened with standard cancer care tests. Participants will get the 2 study drugs in 28-day cycles. EP0057 will be given every 2 weeks, through a small plastic tube in an arm vein. Olaparib will be taken by mouth twice a day most days. Participants will keep a pill diary. For Cycle 1, participants will have 3 visits. All other cycles will have 2 visits. At study visits, participants may have: - Blood and hair samples taken - History and Physical exam - Questions about health and side effects - Pregnancy test - Optional tumor biopsy where a piece of tumor is removed by needle after numbing the skin. - CT scan - Injection of EP0057 (twice per cycle) - Olaparib prescription <TAB> Participants will have a follow-up visit 4 weeks after finish taking the drugs. They will have a physical exam and blood tests. They may have a tumor biopsy. The study team will call the patient every 3 months for follow up after completing the study treatment. ...",

Stereotactic radiosurgery is a specialized type of radiation therapy that delivers a single, high dose of radiation directly to the tumor and may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Whole brain radiation therapy delivers a lower dose of radiation to the entire brain over several treatments. It is not yet known whether stereotactic radiosurgery works better than whole brain radiation therapy in treating patients with non-melanoma brain metastases. Stereotactic radiosurgery may also cause fewer thinking and memory problems than whole brain radiation therapy.",
