Ipilimumab and nivolumab are drugs that treat cancer by blocking certain molecules in the body. This blocking action prevents other molecules from binding to cells involved in the immune system. With these changes, the immune system is more likely to become active, and will react more intensely when activated. The immune system is able to destroy cancer cells and reduce the size of tumors, so activating the immune system is an important part of cancer treatment. Ipilimumab blocks a molecule called CTLA-4, which normally decreases the activation of the immune system by binding to T-Cells, which are important immune system cells that can attack cancer cells. Nivolumab blocks a molecule called PD-1, which also normally decreases the activation of the immune system. Troriluzole is a drug that modulates glutamate, the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the human body. The primary mode of action of troriluzole is reducing synaptic levels of glutamate. This may change parts of the immune system in the brain, which could improve treatment outcomes with anti-cancer drugs such as ipilimumab and nivolumab that can work in the brain. This study is testing troriluzole’s ability to increase the effectiveness of ipilimumab and nivolumab treatment in melanoma that has spread to the brain, as well as testing the safety of the combination of these three drugs.",
