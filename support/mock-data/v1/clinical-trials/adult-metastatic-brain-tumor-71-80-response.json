Chemotherapy drugs, such as cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving chemotherapy with HER2-CAR T cells may kill more tumor cells.",

Most people with lung cancer are already in the advanced stages of the disease by the time they see a doctor. Researchers want to see if combining an approved drug with two new drugs can help. Objective: To study if tetrahydrouridine-decitabine (THU-DAC) with pembrolizumab is safe and effective in people with non-small cell lung cancer that cannot be removed by surgery. Eligibility: People 18 years and older who have NSCLC that cannot be removed by surgery Design: Participants will be screened with - Medical history - Physical exam - Blood and urine tests - Tests of heart and lung function They may have a small tumor sample taken (biopsy). They may have tumor scans. Before starting treatment, participants will repeat the screening tests. They will also give a stool sample. The study will be done in 3-week cycles for up to 6 cycles. - Participants will take the 2 study drugs by mouth 3-5 days a week. - Participants will get pembrolizumab in a vein for 30 minutes 1 day each cycle. Participants will keep a study medication diary. During cycle 1, participants will have blood taken multiple times on days 1 and 2. Every 3 cycles, participants will repeat screening tests. Participants will have a mandatory tumor biopsy. When they finish treatment, participants will have a physical exam and blood tests.",
