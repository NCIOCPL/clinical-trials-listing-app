HER2 and ER are two types of proteins called receptors that can affect the growth of breast cancer cells. Additionally, investigators hope to learn from this study if tumor genetic information is important for predicting whether this type of breast cancer will respond to fulvestrant and copanlisib. Copanlisib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Hormone therapy using fulvestrant may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells. Giving copanlisib and fulvestrant may work better in treating patients with ER+ and HER2- breast cancer compared to fulvestrant alone.",

Infliximab is a type of drug that targets a protein called TNF-alpha. This protein is responsible for regulating the inflammatory response in the body. In diseases such as colitis, there is too much of the TNF-alpha protein which causes certain parts of the body to become inflamed. The excess TNF-alpha protein is causing inflammation in the intestines, resulting in colitis. Infliximab is thought to inhibit (stop) the TNF-alpha protein from working correctly which results in the prevention of the inflammation in the intestines causing colitis. Both methylprednisolone and prednisone are corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory drugs, and it is believed that they help with the inflammation that causes colitis. Giving infliximab or corticosteroids may reduce inflammation and help fight against colitis caused by ipilimumab.",
