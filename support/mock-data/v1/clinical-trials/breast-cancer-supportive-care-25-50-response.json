Stress can also affect how the immune system works. Because treatment for breast cancer can also affect the immune system, the extra effect of stress along with cancer treatment may make patients more vulnerable to things like the flu virus. This can get worse with age. It is critical for older women getting treatment for breast cancer to get help from the flu vaccine. Stress can reduce the body's positive response to the flu vaccine, even in healthy people. Participating in R-CBSM may reduce stress and improve flu vaccine response and general quality of life.

Assessments of lower extremity muscle strength, gait / balance, nerve conduction, neuropathy symptoms, and quality of life (QOL) will be performed. The proposed exercise intervention addresses gait / balance impairments and motor (resistance) components of taxane-induced peripheral neuropathy. The mechanism by which the intervention achieves the proposed outcomes is though 1) increasing endoneurial blood flow to peripheral nerves and mitochondria resulting in reduction in neuropathic symptoms (including pain) and clinical manifestations of peripheral neuropathy, while improving gait / balance in those with persistent neuropathy; 2) The subsequent increase in nutrient supply allows the mitochondria to function more efficiently, and may alleviate the neuropathic manifestations of taxane-induced peripheral neuropathy. 15 This is the first study proposing to test the home-delivery of an exercise intervention specifically aimed at persistent (long-term) taxane-induced neuropathy. If successful, this study will provide the only evidence-based intervention for patients suffering from persistent neuropathy from neurotoxic chemotherapy. Additionally, the home-delivery format makes this intervention easily translated into clinical practice. Specific Aims: In a sample of patients who completed a taxane-containing chemotherapy regimen (> 1 year) for breast cancer and who have a persistent neuropathy (VAS score of > 3) the specific aims of this RCT are: 1. To test the efficacy of a 16-week -delivered program of gait / balance training plus resistance exercise, compared to an educational attention control condition in increasing muscle strength, improving gait / balance and nerve conduction parameters, decreasing the severity of taxane-induced peripheral neuropathy symptoms, and increasing quality of life. 2. To evaluate for differences in muscle strength, gait / balance, sensory (sural) and motor (peroneal) nerve conduction, peripheral neuropathy symptoms, and quality of life (QOL) between patients who receive the exercise program, compared to those in an educational attention control condition controlling for age, BMI, taxane cycles and intervals, neuropathic pain, neuropathy / pain medications, current resistance exercise participation and falls / near falls experienced.",

Many women who are being treated for breast cancer experience declines in memory and attention that go beyond those of normal aging. This study examines memory and attention, lifestyle behaviors, and quality of life in women receiving chemotherapy for their breast cancer. The PACT app may help doctors understand the effects of physical activity on brain health and ultimately develop future interventions to improve quality of life in women receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer.",
