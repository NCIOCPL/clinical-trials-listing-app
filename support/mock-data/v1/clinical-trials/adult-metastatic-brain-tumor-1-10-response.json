Several genes have been found to be altered or mutated in brain metastases such as NTRK, ROS1, CDK or PI3K. Medications that target these genes such as abemaciclib, GDC-0084, and entrectinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Genetic testing may help doctors tailor treatment for each mutation.",

CDK4/6 dual inhibitor LY2835219 specifically inhibits CDK4 and 6, thereby inhibiting retinoblastoma (Rb) protein phosphorylation in early G1. Inhibition of Rb phosphorylation prevents CDK-mediated G1-S phase transition, thereby arresting the cell cycle in the G1 phase, suppressing DNA synthesis and inhibiting cancer cell growth. Overexpression of the serine/threonine kinases CDK4/6, as seen in certain types of cancer, causes cell cycle deregulation. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent.

Upon administration, TrkA/B/C/ROS1/ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor RXDX-101 binds to and inhibits TrkA, TrkB, TrkC, ROS1 and ALK. Inhibition of these kinases may result in a disruption of TrkA-, TrkB-, TrkC-, ROS1-, and ALK-mediated signaling. This leads to an induction of apoptosis and an inhibition of tumor cell proliferation in tumor cells that express these kinases. TrkA, TrkB, TrkC, ROS1 and ALK are overexpressed in a variety of cancer cell types. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent. (NCI Thesaurus)Health professional",

Encorafenib and binimetinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab and nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the tumor, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. This trial aims to find out which approach is more effective in shrinking and controlling brain metastases from melanoma.",
            "detail_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\r\nI. To compare progression-free survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 between participants randomized to the triplet combination of encorafenib + binimetinib + nivolumab versus the doublet combination of ipilimumab + nivolumab among participants with BRAF-V600 mutant melanoma that has metastasized to the brain.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To estimate the overall survival (OS) of participants in each treatment arm.\r\nII. To estimate the objective response rate (ORR) (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial responses) per RECIST 1.1 in each treatment arm.\r\nIII. To estimate the intracranial response rate (ICRR), defined as confirmed and unconfirmed complete and partial response per modified RECIST for brain metastases (mRECIST).\r\nIV. To evaluate the duration of response, per RECIST 1.1 and the duration of ICRR per mRECIST, and per Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO)-Brain Metastases (BM) (and immunotherapy [i]RANO) in each treatment arm.\r\nV. To evaluate the toxicity profile of each treatment arm.\r\nVI. To evaluate current and emerging radiographic response criteria (modified RECIST 1.1, modified RANO-BM and iRANO) by a retrospective blinded independent centralized review (BICR) of banked images.\r\n\r\nBANKING OBJECTIVE:\r\nI. To bank tumor tissue, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), stool and blood samples for future correlative studies.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\r\n\r\nARM I: Patients receive encorafenib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28, binimetinib PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-28, and nivolumab intravenously (IV) on day 1. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nARM II: Patients receive nivolumab IV on day 1 of all cycles and ipilimumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 of cycles 1-4. Cycles repeat every 21 days for 4 cycles and then every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually until 3 years after randomization.",

This may eventually lead to an inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and an inhibition in production of various inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1, -6 and tumor necrosis factor. MEK1/2 are dual-specificity threonine/tyrosine kinases that play key roles in the activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway and are often upregulated in a variety of tumor cell types.

Single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery is a specialized radiation therapy that delivers a single, high dose of radiation directly to the tumor and may cause less damage to normal tissue. Fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery delivers multiple, smaller doses of radiation therapy over time. This study may help doctors find out if fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery is better or worse than the usual approach with single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery.",

To ascertain in patients with resected brain metastases whether there is improved overall QOL as assessed by the FACT-BR and Linear Analog Self-Assessment (LASA) in patients who receive FSRS compared to patients who receive SSRS (Secondary QOL objective).\r\nIV. To compare the functional independence in patients who receive FSRS to patients who receive SSRS.\r\nV. To tabulate and descriptively compare the post-treatment adverse events associated with the interventions, including the potential impact of immunotherapy and targeted therapy.\r\nVI. To compare rates of radiation necrosis at 12 months in patients who receive FSRS to patients who receive SSRS.\r\nVII. To evaluate if there is any difference in central nervous system (CNS) failure patterns (local, distant brain failure, local leptomeningeal disease, widespread leptomeningeal disease) in patients who receive FSRS compared to patients who receive SSRS after resection of brain metastasis.\r\nVIII. To ascertain in patients with resected brain metastases whether there is increased time to whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) in patients who receive FSRS compared to patients who receive SSRS.\r\nIX. To determine in long-term survivors (patients who are alive more than 12 months from time of randomization) whether there is better emotional well-being and overall QOL as assessed by the FACT-BR and LASA in patients who receive FSRS to the surgical bed compared to patients who receive SSRS (Secondary QOL objective).\r\nX. To ascertain if time to surgical bed failure as assessed by central review is increased with FSRS compared to SSRS in patients with resected brain metastasis.\r\nXI. To ascertain in patients with resected brain metastases whether there is improved QOL as assessed by all other total and individual FACT-BR and LASA items and subscale values in patients who receive FSRS compared to patients who receive SSRS (Exploratory QOL objective). \r\nXII. To determine in patients with resected brain metastases whether there is less cognitive progression in patients who receive FSRS to the surgical bed compared to patients who receive SSRS (Exploratory cognitive objective). \r\n\r\nCORRELATIVE SCIENCE OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To collect and bank blood and tissue for future correlative studies.\r\nII. To ascertain if there are differences in local site versus centrally reviewed scan-reads; specifically differences in dates of progression or patterns of failure. \r\nIII. To differentiate tumor recurrence and radiation necrosis using an image-based biomechanically-coupled tumor growth model to estimate patient-specific model parameters and model-derived measures.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\r\n\r\nARM I: Patients undergo SSRS over 1 session.\r\n\r\nARM II: Patients undergo FSRS over 3 or 5 daily sessions.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study, patients are followed up at 30 days, at 3, 6, 9, 12, 16, and 24 months, then every 6 months until 5 years from randomization.",

Sacituzumab govitecan is a monoclonal antibody, called sacituzumab, linked to a chemotherapy drug, called govitecan. Sacituzumab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules on the surface of cancer cells, known as Trop-2 receptors, and delivers govitecan to kill them. Giving sacituzumab govitecan may shrink the cancer in the brain and / or extend the time until the cancer gets worse.",

To evaluate the intracranial objective response rate (ORR) (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR] by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Brain Metastases [RANO-BM]) with sacituzumab govitecan (IMMU-132) in patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer with brain involvement.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To evaluate bi-compartmental progression-free survival in this population.\r\nII. To evaluate overall survival in this population.\r\nIII. To assess safety and tolerability of sacituzumab govitecan (IMMU-132) treatment in this population.\r\nIV. To evaluate ORR by hormone-receptor (HR) subgroup (HR+, HR-).\r\n\r\nBANKING OBJECTIVE:\r\nI. To bank specimens for future correlative studies.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE:\r\nPatients receive sacituzumab govitecan intravenously (IV) over 1-3 hours on days 1 and 8. Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study registration, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 1 year.",

The antibody moiety of IMMU-132 selectively binds to TROP2. After internalization and proteolytic cleavage, SN-38 selectively stabilizes topoisomerase I-DNA covalent complexes, resulting in DNA breaks that inhibit DNA replication and trigger apoptosis. TROP2, also known as epithelial glycoprotein-1 (EGP-1), is a transmembrane calcium signal transducer that is overexpressed by a variety of human epithelial carcinomas; this antigen is involved in the regulation of cell-cell adhesion and its expression is associated with increased cancer growth, aggressiveness and metastasis.

            "brief_summary": "This phase III trial studies stereotactic radiosurgery to see how well it works compared to hippocampus avoidance whole-brain radiation therapy with memantine in treating patients with 5-15 brain tumors that have spread from other places in the body. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a specialized radiation therapy that delivers a single, high dose of radiation directly to the tumor and may cause less damage to normal tissue. Hippocampus avoidance whole-brain radiation therapy delivers radiation to the entire brain except for the hippocampus. The hippocampus is a brain structure that is important for memory. Hippocampus avoidance during whole-brain radiation therapy decreases the amount of radiation that is delivered to this area. Memantine is often given with whole brain radiation therapy and may decrease the risk of cognitive side effects after radiation therapy to the brain. It is not yet known whether stereotactic radiosurgery or whole-brain radiation therapy works better in treating patients with 5-15 brain metastases.",
            "detail_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To compare the overall survival in patients with five to fifteen brain metastases who receive stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) compared to patients who receive hippocampal-avoidant whole-brain radiation therapy (HA-WBRT) plus memantine hydrochloride (memantine).\r\nII. To compare the neurocognitive progression-free survival in patients with five to fifteen brain metastases who receive SRS compared to patients who receive HA-WBRT plus memantine.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To compare time to central nervous system (CNS) failure (local, distant, and leptomeningeal) in patients who receive SRS compared to patients who receive HA-WBRT plus memantine.\r\nII. To evaluate if there is any difference in CNS failure patterns (local, distant, or leptomeningeal) in patients who receive SRS compared to patients who receive HA-WBRT plus memantine.\r\nIII. To evaluate number of salvage procedures following SRS in comparison to HA-WBRT plus memantine.\r\nIV. To evaluate the individual cognitive test results following SRS in comparison to HA-WBRT plus memantine.\r\nV. To tabulate and descriptively compare the post-treatment adverse events associated with the interventions.\r\nVI. To evaluate the time delay to (re-)initiation of systemic therapy in patients receiving SRS in comparison to HA-WBRT plus memantine.\r\nVII. To prospectively validate a predictive nomogram for distant brain failure.\r\nVIII. To compare the estimated cost of brain-related therapies in patients who receive SRS compared to patients who receive HA-WBRT plus memantine.\r\nIX. To evaluate patient’s quality of life, as assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (QLQ-C30) + Brain Cancer Module (BN20), European Quality of Life-5-Dimensional (EQ-5D), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, for those who receive SRS compared to those who receive HA-WBRT plus memantine.\r\nX. Collect plasma to evaluate whether detectable somatic mutations in liquid biopsy can enhance prediction of the overall survival and development of new brain metastases.\r\nXI. Analysis of serum samples for inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein and brain-derived-neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to elucidate molecular/genomic mechanisms of neurocognitive decline and associated radiographic changes.\r\nXII. Collect whole-brain dosimetry on all patients to be prospectively correlated with cognitive toxicity, intracranial control and radiation necrosis (hippocampal dosimetry will be retrospectively assessed).\r\nXIII. Collect imaging parameters and workflow details relating to the radiosurgery planning MRIs (including timing of MR prior to radiosurgery, magnet field strength, contrast type/dose/timing, use of image post-processing, and formal reviewed by radiology) to be prospectively correlated with tumor control outcomes (local control, intracranial control).\r\nXIV. Evaluate serial changes in imaging features found in routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images (T2w changes, morphometry) that may predict tumor control and/or neurocognitive outcomes\r\n\r\nOUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\r\n\r\nARM I: Patients receive memantine hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for up to 24 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo 10 fractions of HA-WBRT daily for up to 3 weeks.\r\n\r\nARM II: Patients undergo 1 fraction of SRS.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 8 weeks, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, and 24 months, then annually afterwards.",

This may eventually lead to an inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and an inhibition in production of various inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1, -6 and tumor necrosis factor.

Binimetinib, noncompetitive with ATP, binds to and inhibits the activity of MEK1/2. Inhibition of MEK1/2 prevents the activation of MEK1/2-dependent effector proteins and transcription factors, which may result in the inhibition of growth factor-mediated cell signaling. This may eventually lead to an inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and an inhibition in production of various inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1, -6 and tumor necrosis factor. MEK1/2 are dual-specificity threonine/tyrosine kinases that play key roles in the activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway and are often upregulated in a variety of tumor cell types.

Neratinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is a monoclonal antibody, called trastuzumab, linked to a chemotherapy drug called DM1. Trastuzumab attaches to HER2 positive cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers DM1 to kill them. Giving neratinib, capecitabine, and trastuzumab emtansine together may be an effective treatment for breast cancer.",
            "detail_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: \r\nI. To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) in the central nervous system (CNS) by composite response criteria in Cohort 1, Cohort 3A, and Cohort 3B. \r\nII. To evaluate the ORR in the CNS by more modern criteria, namely the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Brain Metastases (RANO-BM) criteria, separately in Cohorts 4A, 4B, and 4C.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES: \r\nI. ORR in non-CNS sites (by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST 1.1] criteria). (All Cohorts)\r\nII. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). (All Cohorts)\r\nIII. CNS response by Macdonald criteria. (Cohort 1 only)\r\nIV. CNS response by volumetric/composite criteria. (Secondary endpoint for Cohorts 4A-4C only as this is primary objective for Cohorts 1, 3A-3B)\r\nV. First site of disease progression. (All Cohorts)\r\nVI. Safety and tolerability of therapy. (All Cohorts)\r\nVII. Time to CNS radiation. (Cohort 4A only)\r\nVIII. Association of circulating tumor cell (CTC) count and OS. (Cohort 1 only)\r\nIX. Assess clinical outcomes for patients who opt to receive trastuzumab and neratinib at the time of non-CNS progression (i.e. toxicity, CNS and non-CNS response, site of first progression, OS). (Cohort 1 only)\r\n\r\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES: \r\nI. PFS and OS in patients who undergo craniotomy. (Cohort 2)\r\nII. PFS from the time of addition of capecitabine for Cohort 2 patients.\r\nIII. ORR in the CNS for lapatinib-naive patients versus (vs.) lapatinib-treated patients. (All Cohorts)\r\nIV. Explore the association of MET (hepatocyte growth factor receptor) and HER2 co-amplification (in CTCs) with treatment response. (Cohorts 1, 3A/3B)\r\nV. Explore the relationship between the HER2 status of a patient’s primary breast cancer, metastatic lesions, and CTCs using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for HER2 gene amplification. (Cohorts 1, 3A/3B)\r\nVI. Explore the possible mechanisms of resistance driven by Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) using FISH for EGFR gene amplification in HER2-positive CTCs. (Cohorts 1, 3A/3B)\r\nVII. Assess neratinib concentrations and concentrations of its metabolites in CNS tumor, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma at craniotomy in patients who receive neratinib prior to surgery. (Cohort 2)\r\nVIII. Examine neurocognitive function for patients with varying previous therapies for CNS disease. (Cohort 1)\r\nIX. Explore primary archival samples and metastatic samples when able to evaluate for predictors of response and outcome. (Cohorts 3A/3B)\r\nX. Perform molecular characterization of potential resistance mechanisms, predictive biomarkers, and immunological function by collecting blood and tumor specimens. (Cohort 3A/3B, 4A/4B/4C)\r\nXI. Examine changes in the mutational profiles of one’s disease using circulating tumor (ct) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (all Cohort 4 patients) in blood and in CSF (for any Cohort 4 patient undergoing lumbar puncture).\r\nXII. Evaluate patient-reported gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity and its impact on quality of life for patients receiving neratinib and trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1). (Cohort 4 patients only, cycles 1-3)\r\nXIII. Compare patient-reported and clinician-reported gastrointestinal adverse events during the first 3 cycles of T-DM1 and neratinib therapy. (Cohort 4 patients)\r\nXIV. Evaluate self-reported adherence using the Voils measure to anti-diarrheal prophylaxis during cycle 1 and anti-diarrheal medication diaries during T-DM1 and neratinib therapy. (All Cohort 4 patients)\r\nXV. Compare (exploratory endpoint) symptom reporting for Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and Systemic Therapy Induced Diarrhea Assessment Tool (STIDAT) measures for diarrhea. (Cohorts 4A-4C)\r\n\r\nOUTLINE:\r\nCOHORT I: Patients receive neratinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. \r\n\r\nCOHORT II: Patients receive neratinib PO QD for 7-21 days and then undergo craniotomy. Patients resume neratinib within 10 days post-operatively.\r\n\r\nCOHORTS IIIA/IIIB: Patients receive neratinib PO QD on days 1-21 and capecitabine PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-14. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nCOHORTS IVA-IVC: Patients receive neratinib PO QD on days 1-21 and trastuzumab emtansine intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nEXTENSION PHASE: Patients achieving CNS response or disease stability yet develop disease progression outside of the CNS receive trastuzumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes every 7 or 21 days. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. \r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up approximately every 6 months for up to 2 years.",

The device is an experimental, portable, battery operated device for chronic administration of alternating electric fields (termed TTFields or TTF) to the region of the malignant tumor, by means of surface, insulated electrode arrays.",
            "detail_description": "PAST PRE-CLINICAL AND CLINICAL EXPERIENCE:\r\n\r\n      The effect of the electric fields (TTFields, TTF) has demonstrated significant activity in in\r\n      vitro and in vivo NSCLC pre-clinical models both as a single modality treatment and in\r\n      combination with chemotherapies. TTFields have also shown to inhibit metastatic spread of\r\n      malignant melanoma in in vivo experiment.\r\n\r\n      In a pilot study, 42 patients with advanced NSCLC who had tumor progression after at least\r\n      one line of prior chemotherapy, received pemetrexed together with TTFields (150 kHz) applied\r\n      to the chest and upper abdomen until disease progression (Pless M., et al., Lung Cancer\r\n      2011). Efficacy endpoints were remarkably high compared to historical data for pemetrexed\r\n      alone.\r\n\r\n      In addition, a phase III trial of Optune® (200 kHz) as monotherapy compared to active\r\n      chemotherapy in recurrent glioblastoma patients showed TTFields to be equivalent to active\r\n      chemotherapy in extending survival, associated with minimal toxicity, good quality of life,\r\n      and activity within the brain (14% response rate) (Stupp R., et al., EJC 2012). Finally, a\r\n      phase III trial of Optune® combined with maintenance temozolomide compared to maintenance\r\n      temozolomide alone has shown that combined therapy led to a significant improvement in both\r\n      progression free survival and overall survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma\r\n      without the addition of high grade toxicity and without decline in quality of life (Stupp R.,\r\n      et al., JAMA 2015).\r\n\r\n      Applying TTFields at 150 kHz to the brain for the treatment of 1-5 brain metastasis from\r\n      NSCLC using the NovoTTF-100M device has been demonstrated to be safe in a pilot study, where\r\n      patients were randomized after local therapy of their brain metastasis by neurosurgery and/or\r\n      stereotactic radiosurgery to receive either NovoTTF-100M treatment or supportive care alone.\r\n      Eighteen (18) patients have been enrolled in the study. There have been no device-related\r\n      serious adverse events (SAE) reported to date (Brozova H., et al., Neuro Oncol 2016).\r\n\r\n      DESCRIPTION OF THE TRIAL:\r\n\r\n      All patients included in this trial are patients with 1-10 brain metastases from NSCLC which\r\n      are amenable to stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). In addition, all patients must meet all\r\n      eligibility criteria.\r\n\r\n      Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups:\r\n\r\n        1. Patients undergo SRS followed by TTFields using the NovoTTF-100M System\r\n\r\n        2. Patients undergo SRS alone and receive supportive care.\r\n\r\n      Patients in both arms of the study may receive systemic therapy for their NSCLC at the\r\n      discretion of their treating physician.\r\n\r\n      Patients will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio. Baseline tests will be performed in patients\r\n      enrolled in both arms. If assigned to the NovoTTF-100M group, the patients will be treated\r\n      continuously with the device until second intracranial progression.\r\n\r\n      On both arms, patients who recur anywhere in the brain will be offered one of the following\r\n      salvage treatments (according to local practice) including, but not limited to:\r\n\r\n        -  Surgery\r\n\r\n        -  Repeat SRS\r\n\r\n        -  Whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT)\r\n\r\n      Patients on the control arm will be offered to cross over to the NovoTTF-100M arm of the\r\n      study and receive TTFields after salvage therapy for second intracranial progression if the\r\n      investigator believes it is in the best interest of the patient and patient agrees.\r\n\r\n      SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND:\r\n\r\n      Electric fields exert forces on electric charges similar to the way a magnet exerts forces on\r\n      metallic particles within a magnetic field. These forces cause movement and rotation of\r\n      electrically charged biological building blocks, much like the alignment of metallic\r\n      particles seen along the lines of force radiating outwards from a magnet.\r\n\r\n      Electric fields can also cause muscles to twitch and if strong enough may heat tissues.\r\n      TTFields are alternating electric fields of low intensity. This means that they change their\r\n      direction repetitively many times a second. Since they change direction very rapidly (150\r\n      thousand times a second), they do not cause muscles to twitch, nor do they have any effects\r\n      on other electrically activated tissues in the body (brain, nerves and heart). Since the\r\n      intensities of TTFields in the body are very low, they do not cause heating.\r\n\r\n      The breakthrough finding made by Novocure was that finely tuned alternating fields of very\r\n      low intensity, now termed TTFields (Tumor Treating Fields), cause a significant slowing in\r\n      the growth of cancer cells. Due to the unique geometric shape of cancer cells when they are\r\n      multiplying, TTFields cause electrically-charged cellular components of these cells to change\r\n      their location within the dividing cell, disrupting their normal function and ultimately\r\n      leading to cell death.. In addition, cancer cells also contain miniature building blocks\r\n      which act as tiny motors in moving essential parts of the cells from place to place. TTFields\r\n      interfere with the normal orientation of these tiny motors related to other cellular\r\n      components since they are electrically-charged as well. As a result of these two effects,\r\n      tumor cell division is slowed, results in cellular death or reverses after continuous\r\n      exposure to TTFields.\r\n\r\n      Other cells in the body (normal healthy tissues) are affected much less than cancer cells\r\n      since they multiply at a much slower rate if at all. In addition TTFields can be directed to\r\n      a certain part of the body, leaving sensitive areas out of their reach. Finally, the\r\n      frequency of TTFields applied to each type of cancer is specific and may not damage normally\r\n      dividing cells in healthy tissues.\r\n\r\n      In conclusion, TTFields hold the promise of serving as a brand new treatment for brain\r\n      metastases from NSCLC with very few side effects.",

When a cancer has a PI3K pathway mutation, it sends signals to other cells in the body to encourage rapid growth, leading to the spread of cancer. PI3K mutations are common in many types of cancer, and they cause radiation therapy to be less effective. GDC-0084 reduces the activity of PI3K-related signaling. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving GDC-0084 with whole or partial brain radiation therapy may be an effective treatment for solid tumors brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases.",

To determine the safety and toxicity of concurrent paxalisib (GDC-0084) and radiation therapy to the brain in patients with solid tumor brain metastases and/or leptomeningeal metastases harboring PI3K pathway mutations.\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To determine the local recurrence rate of brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases treated with concurrent GDC-0084 and radiation therapy to the brain in patients with solid tumor brain metastases harboring PI3K pathway mutations.\r\nII. To determine the intracranial progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with solid tumor brain metastases harboring PI3K pathway mutations.\r\nIII. To further assess the safety and toxicity of protocol therapy in the dose expansion cohort.\r\n\r\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\r\nI. To assess feasibility of isolating and evaluating pre-treatment and post-treatment cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers including: circulating tumor cells (CTC), cell free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (cfDNA), cytokines, and ribonucleic acid (RNA) and protein analysis of the CSF cellular component.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of GDC-0084.\r\n\r\nPatients receive GDC-0084 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21, and undergo undergo whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) or partial radiation brain therapy (PBRT) for 10 fractions over approximately 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, 9,and 12 months, and then every 3 months thereafter.",

Upon oral administration, AZD9291 covalently binds to and inhibits the activity of mutant forms of EGFR, including the T790M EGFR mutant, thereby preventing EGFR-mediated signaling. This may both induce cell death and inhibit tumor growth in EGFR-overexpressing tumor cells. EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase mutated in many tumor cell types, plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and tumor vascularization. AZD9291 preferentially inhibits mutated forms of EGFR including T790M, a secondarily-acquired resistance mutation, and may have enhanced anti-tumor effects in tumors with T790M-mediated resistance when compared to other EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. As this agent is selective towards mutant forms of EGFR, its toxicity profile may be reduced when compared to non-selective EGFR inhibitors which also inhibit wild-type EGF",

Upon oral administration, AZD9291 covalently binds to and inhibits the activity of mutant forms of EGFR, including the T790M EGFR mutant, thereby preventing EGFR-mediated signaling. This may both induce cell death and inhibit tumor growth in EGFR-overexpressing tumor cells. EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase mutated in many tumor cell types, plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and tumor vascularization. AZD9291 preferentially inhibits mutated forms of EGFR including T790M, a secondarily-acquired resistance mutation, and may have enhanced anti-tumor effects in tumors with T790M-mediated resistance when compared to other EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. As this agent is selective towards mutant forms of EGFR, its toxicity profile may be reduced when compared to non-selective EGFR inhibitors which also inhibit wild-type EGF",
