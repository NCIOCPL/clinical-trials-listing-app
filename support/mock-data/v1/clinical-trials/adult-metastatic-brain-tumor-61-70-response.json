GLIADEL is a wafer that is used to deliver the anticancer drug carmustine directly into a brain tumor site after the tumor has been removed by surgery. Chemotherapy drugs, such as carmustine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Stereotactic radiosurgery uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This method may kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving GLIADEL or stereotactic radiosurgery after surgery may help keep the cancer from coming back.",

The NovoTTF-200A System is a portable device which produces changing electrical fields, called tumor treatment fields (“TTFields”) within the human body. TTFields stop the growth of tumor cells resulting in cell death of the rapidly dividing cancer cells. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving TTFields may sensitize the tumor cells to immune therapies such as pembrolizumab.",

This trial involves taking cells called lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) from patients' tumors, growing them in the laboratory in large numbers, and then giving the cells back to the patient. These cells are called tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and the therapy is called cell therapy. Giving chemotherapy drugs, such as cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, before treating with these cells may temporarily suppress the immune system to improve the chances that the tumor fighting cells will be able to survive in the body. Giving aldesleukin after the cell administration may help the tumor fighting cells stay alive longer. Giving tumor fighting cells (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes) followed by aldesleukin may cause the cancer to shrink.",

G207 has been genetically changed and weakened, in the hope that only cancer cells will be infected and killed by the virus, without harming normal brain tissue.
