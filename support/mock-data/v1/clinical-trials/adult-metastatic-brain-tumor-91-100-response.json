Cycle 1 of study treatment will consist of Olaparib given twice daily concurrently with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Olaparib will start one week prior to SRS and continue during and following SRS (1-5 fractions) for up to 28 days total. The number of doses of Olaparib will be dependent on how long it takes a subject to recover from SRS (ideally the subject will be off steroids, if they are required, at the start of Cycle 2, with exceptions outlined later in this section). Once the subject has recovered from SRS, Cycle 2 will be initiated with physician's choice systemic therapy and durvalumab. Cycle 2+ will equal 21 days. During Cycles 2 and 3, physician's choice systemic monotherapy will be given along with durvalumab per section 5.3. Each cycle will last 21 days. Imaging to evaluate intracranial and extracranial disease will be performed after Cycle 3, and subjects with response will continue with the systemic therapy and durvalumab until progression (intracranial or extracranial), unacceptable toxicity or death.",

Dendritic cell vaccines work by boosting the immune system (a system in the body that protect against infection) to recognize and destroy the cancer cells. CKM regimen, consisting of rintatolimod, interferon alpha-2b and celecoxib, attempt to direct the immune cells to the cancer cells and maximize the effectiveness of pembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab is an “immune checkpoint inhibitor” which is designed to either “unleash” or “enhance” the cancer immune responses that already exist by either blocking inhibitory molecules” or by activating stimulatory molecules. Giving dendritic cell vaccines, CKM regimen, and pembrolizumab may shrink the cancer.",

Objectives: To see if a gene transfer with anti-CD70 cells can safely shrink tumors and to be certain the treatment is safe. Eligibility: Adults age 18 and older diagnosed with cancer that has the CD70-expressing cancer. Design: Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, scans, and other tests. They may by admitted to the hospital. Leukapheresis will be performed. For this, blood is removed through a needle in the arm. A machine separates the white blood cells. The rest of the blood is returned through a needle in the other arm. Eligible participants will have an intravenous catheter placed in their upper chest. Over several days, they will get chemotherapy drugs and the anti-CD70 cells. They will recover in the hospital. Participants will take an antibiotic for 6 months after treatment.
