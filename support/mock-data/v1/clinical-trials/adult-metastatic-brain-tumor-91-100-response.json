GLIADEL is a wafer that is used to deliver the anticancer drug carmustine directly into a brain tumor site after the tumor has been removed by surgery. Chemotherapy drugs, such as carmustine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Stereotactic radiosurgery uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This method may kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving GLIADEL or stereotactic radiosurgery after surgery may help keep the cancer from coming back.","detail_description":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\r\nI.To evaluate, in a phase II non-inferiority study, the efficacy of carmustine implant (GLIADEL) local chemotherapy compared to stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in preventing local recurrence after resection of a metastatic brain tumor (local recurrence at surgical site).\r\n\r\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\r\nI. To evaluate the intracranial progression-free survival of patients with metastatic lesions to the brain treated with or without the insertion of GLIADEL wafers (as determined by the operative site).\r\nII. To evaluate the neurocognitive status of patients undergoing surgical intervention and insertion of GLIADEL wafers or adjuvant SRS in patients with metastatic brain cancer.\r\n\r\nOTHER OBJECTIVE:\r\nI. To obtain tissue from primary and metastatic sites and blood to determine the differences in the genome between the metastatic brain tumor, the primary tumor, and the germline to assess mutations over time.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\r\n\r\nARM I: During surgical resection, patients receive carmustine implant. Within 6 weeks after surgical resection, patients undergo SRS to any other lesions.\r\n\r\nARM II: Within 6 weeks after surgical resection, patients undergo SRS to the resection bed and any other lesions.\r\n\r\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 months, every 3 months in year 1, every 4 months in year 2, and then every 6 months in year

Cancer","Genitourinary Cancer"],"brief_summary":"Background: The NCI Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy that involves taking white blood cells from patients' tumors, growing them in the laboratory in large numbers, and then giving the cells back to the patient. These cells are called Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes, or TIL and we have given this type of treatment to over 200 patients with melanoma. Researchers want to know if TIL shrink s tumors in people with digestive tract, urothelial, breast, or ovarian / endometrial cancers. In this study, we are selecting a specific subset of white blood cells from the tumor that we think are the most effective in fighting tumors and will use only these cells in making the tumor fighting cells. Objective: The purpose of this study is to see if these specifically selected tumor fighting cells can cause digestive tract, urothelial, breast, or ovarian / endometrial tumors to shrink and to see if this treatment is safe. Eligibility: - Adults age 18-70 with upper or lower gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, genitourinary, breast, ovarian / endometrial cancer, or glioblastoma refractory to standard chemotherapy. Design: Work up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the NIH clinical Center and undergo a history and physical examination, scans, x-rays, lab tests, and other tests as needed. Surgery: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will undergo surgery to remove a tumor that can be used to grow the TIL product. Leukapheresis: Patients may undergo leukapheresis to obtain additional white blood cells. {Leukapheresis is a common procedure, which removes only the white blood cells from the patient.} Treatment: Once their cells have grown, the patients will be admitted to the hospital for the conditioning chemotherapy, the TIL cells and aldesleukin. They will stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment. Follow up: Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side effects, lab tests, and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months to 1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking. Follow up visits will take up to 2 days.","detail_description":"Background:\r\n\r\n        -  Metastatic digestive tract cancers, in particular esophageal, gastric, pancreatic and\r\n           hepatobiliary carcinomas, are associated with poor survival beyond five years and poor\r\n           response to existing therapies.\r\n\r\n        -  Data from the National Cancer Institute Surgery Branch (NCI-SB) and from the literature\r\n           support that metastatic cancers are potentially immunogenic and that tumor-infiltrating\r\n\r\n      lymphocytes (TIL) can be grown and expanded from these tumors.\r\n\r\n        -  In metastatic melanoma, TIL can mediate the regression of bulky disease at any site when\r\n           administered to an autologous patient with high-dose aldesleukin (IL-2) following a\r\n           nonmyeloablative, lymphodepleting preparative regimen.\r\n\r\n        -  The recent young-TIL approach, in which TIL are minimally cultured in vitro, not\r\n           selected for tumor recognition, before rapid expansion and infusion to metastatic\r\n           melanoma patients, has lead to objective response rates comparable to previous trials\r\n           relying on TIL screened for tumor recognition, with no added toxicities.\r\n\r\n        -  In pre-clinical models, the administration of an anti-PD-1 antibody enhances the\r\n           anti-tumor activity of transferred T-cells.\r\n\r\n        -  We propose to investigate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of TIL adoptive transfer\r\n           therapy in combination with pembrolizumab, administered either prior to cell\r\n           administration or at the time of progressive disease, for metastatic cancers.\r\n\r\n      Objectives:\r\n\r\n      -Primary objective:\r\n\r\n      --With Amendment BB, to determine the rate of tumor regression in patients with metastatic\r\n      cancer who receive autologous, minimally cultured TIL in conjunction with a\r\n      non-myeloablative, lymphodepleting preparative regimen, high-dose aldesleukin, and anti-PD-1.\r\n\r\n      Eligibility:\r\n\r\n      Patients must be/have:\r\n\r\n        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years and less than or equal to 70 years\r\n\r\n        -  Metastatic upper or lower gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, genitourinary, breast,\r\n           ovarian/endometrial cancer, or glioblastoma refractory to standard chemotherapy\r\n\r\n        -  Normal basic laboratory values\r\n\r\n      Patients may not have:\r\n\r\n        -  Concurrent major medical illnesses\r\n\r\n        -  Severe hepatic function impairment due to liver metastatic burden\r\n\r\n        -  Unpalliated biliary or bowel occlusion, cholangitis, or digestive tract bleeding\r\n\r\n        -  Any form of immunodeficiency\r\n\r\n        -  Severe hypersensitivity to any of the agents used in this study\r\n\r\n      Design:\r\n\r\n        -  Patients may undergo resection or biopsy to obtain tumor for generation of autologous\r\n           TIL cultures and autologous cancer cell lines, and for frozen tissue archive. Lymph\r\n           nodes, ascites,peritoneal implants, and normal tissue adjacent to metastatic deposit\r\n           will also be obtained when possible for ongoing and future research as described in the\r\n           NCI-SB cell harvest protocol 03-C-0277 (Cell Harvest and Preparation for Surgery Branch\r\n           Adoptive Cell Therapy Protocols).\r\n\r\n        -  With the approval of Amendment BB, patients will be enrolled on Arm 3 or Arm 4. All\r\n           patients will receive a non-myeloablative, lymphodepleting preparative regimen\r\n           consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine followed by the infusion of autologous\r\n           TIL and high-dose aldesleukin. Patients enrolled on Arm 3 will receive pembrolizumab\r\n           prior to cell administration and three additional doses every three weeks following the\r\n           cell infusion. Patients enrolled on Arm 4 will receive pembrolizumab within four weeks\r\n           after meeting progressive disease by RECIST criteria, continuing for up to 8 doses every\r\n           3 weeks.\r\n\r\n        -  Clinical and immunologic response will be evaluated about 6 weeks after cell infusion\r\n           and periodically thereafter.\r\n\r\n        -  Twenty-one patients will initially be enrolled in each group to assess toxicity and\r\n           tumor responses. If two or more of the first 21 patients per groups shows a clinical\r\n           response (partial response or complete response), accrual will continue to 41 patients,\r\n           targeting a 20% goal for objective response.\r\n\r\n        -  Up to 332 patients may be enrolled.","classification_code":null,"interventional_model":"Parallel","study_source":"Institutional","accepts_healthy_volunteers_indicator":"NO","study_protocol_type":"Interventional","study_subtype_code":null,"study_population_description":null,"study_model_code":null,"study_model_other_text":null,"sampling_method_code":null,"why_study_stopped":"Not provided","bio_specimen":{"f1":"bio_specimen_description","f2":null,"f3":"bio_specimen_retention_code","f4":null},"primary_purpose":{"primary_purpose_code":"TREATMENT","primary_purpose_other_text":null,"primary_purpose_additional_qualifier_code":null},"phase":{"phase":"II","phase_other_text":null,"phase_additional_qualifier_code":"NO"},"masking":{"masking":null,"masking_allocation_code":"Non-Randomized Trial","masking_role_investigator":null,"masking_role_outcome_assessor":null,"masking_role_subject":null,"masking_role_caregiver":null},"principal_investigator":"Steven A.

these cells using a virus. The cells are then given back to the person. This is called gene transfer. For this study, researchers will modify the person s white blood cells with anti-CD70. Objectives: To see if a gene transfer with anti-CD70 cells can safely shrink tumors and to be certain the treatment is safe. Eligibility: Adults age 18 and older diagnosed with cancer that has the CD70-expressing cancer. Design: Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, scans, and other tests. They may by admitted to the hospital. Leukapheresis will be performed. For this, blood is removed through a needle in the arm. A machine separates the white blood cells. The rest of the blood is returned through a needle in the other arm. Eligible participants will have an intravenous catheter placed in their upper chest. Over several days, they will get chemotherapy drugs and the anti-CD70 cells. They will recover in the hospital. Participants will take an antibiotic for 6 months after treatment. They will repeat leukapheresis. Participants will visit the clinic every 1-3 months for the first year after treatment, every 6 months for the second year, and then as determined by their physician. Follow-up visits will take 1-2 days. At each visit, participants will have lab tests, imaging studies, and a physical exam. Throughout the study, blood will be taken and participants will have many tests to determine the size and extent of their tumor and the treatment s impact.","detail_description":"Background:\r\n\r\n        -  We generated a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that engages CD70 using its natural\r\n           ligand CD27, as the binding moiety. Transducing peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) with\r\n           this CAR conveys major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-independent recognition of\r\n           CD70-expressing target cells, which include renal cell carcinoma and other cancers.\r\n\r\n        -  In co-cultures with CD70+ target cells, anti-hCD70 CAR transduced T cells secrete\r\n           significant amounts of IFN-gamma with high specificity.\r\n\r\n      Objectives:\r\n\r\n      Primary objectives:\r\n\r\n        -  Phase I: Determine the safety of administering PBL transduced with anti-hCD70 CAR in\r\n           concert with preparative lymphodepletion and high dose interleukin-2 (IL-2;\r\n           aldesleukin).\r\n\r\n        -  Phase II: Determine if anti-hCD70 CAR-transduced PBL can mediate the regression of CD70\r\n           expressing tumors.\r\n\r\n      Eligibility:\r\n\r\n        -  Patients must be/have:\r\n\r\n           --Metastatic or unresectable CD70-expressing cancer which has progressed after standard\r\n           therapy\r\n\r\n        -  Patients may not have:\r\n\r\n             -  Allergies or hypersensitivities to high-dose aldesleukin, cyclophosphamide, or\r\n                fludarabine.\r\n\r\n      Design:\r\n\r\n        -  This is a phase I/II, single center study of PBL transduced with anti-hCD70 CAR in\r\n           patients with measurable, unresectable cancer expressing CD70.\r\n\r\n        -  PBMC obtained by leukapheresis will be cultured in the presence of anti-CD3 (OKT3) and\r\n           aldesleukin in order to stimulate T-cell growth.\r\n\r\n        -  Transduction is initiated by exposure of these cells to retroviral vector supernatant\r\n           containing replication-incompetent virus encoding the anti-hCD70 CAR.\r\n\r\n        -  All patients will receive a non-myeloablative, lymphodepleting preparative regimen of\r\n           cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.\r\n\r\n        -  On day 0, patients will receive PBL transduced with the anti-hCD70 CAR and will then\r\n           begin high-dose aldesleukin.\r\n\r\n        -  A complete evaluation of lesions will be conducted approximately 6 weeks (plus or minus\r\n           two weeks) after treatment.\r\n\r\n        -  The study will be conducted using a Phase I/II optimal design, with two separate cohorts\r\n           for the Phase II component:Cohort 2a, patients with CD70-expressing clear cell renal\r\n           cell carcinoma (RCC), and Cohort 2b, patients with a CD70-expressing non-RCC malignancy\r\n           (solid tumors only).\r\n\r\n        -  A total of up to 124 patients may be required; approximately 38 patients in the Phase I\r\n           portion of the study and 43 (41, plus an allowance of up to 2 non-evaluable) patients in\r\n           each

It takes young tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (Young TIL) cells from a person s tumors and grows them in a lab. Then they are returned to the person. Researchers think adding the drug pembrolizumab might make the therapy more effective. Objective: To test if adding pembrolizumab to cell therapy is safe and effective to shrink melanoma tumors. Eligibility: People ages 18 70 years with metastatic melanoma Design: Participants will be screened with: Physical exam CT, MRI, or PET scans X-rays Heart and lung function tests Blood and urine tests Before treatment, participants will have: A piece of tumor taken from a biopsy or during surgery in order to grow TIL cells Leukapheresis: Blood flows through a needle in one arm and into a machine that removes white blood cells. The rest of the blood returns through a needle in the other arm. An IV catheter placed in the chest for getting TIL cells, aldesleukin, and pembrolizumab (if assigned) Participants will stay in the hospital for treatment. This includes: Daily chemotherapy for 1 week For some participants, pembrolizumab infusion 1 day after chemotherapy TIL cell infusion 2 4 days after chemotherapy, then aldesleukin infusion every 8 hours for up to 12 doses Possible filgrastim injection Recovery for 1 2 weeks After treatment, participants will: Take an antibiotic and antiviral for at least 6 months If assigned, have pembrolizumab treatment every 3 weeks for 3 more doses. They may have another round.

Various cytoplasmic signaling molecules are recruited to the activated receptor complex and become substrates for regulatory enzymes that are associated with the receptor complex. This agent enhances lymphocyte mitogenesis; stimulates long-term growth of human IL-2 dependent cell lines; enhances lymphocyte cytotoxicity; induces lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell and natural killer (NK) cell activities; and induces expression of interferon-gamma.

Upon administration, pembrolizumab binds to PD-1, an inhibitory signaling receptor expressed on the surface of activated T cells, and blocks the binding to and activation of PD-1 by its ligands, which results in the activation of T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. The ligands for PD-1 include PD-L1, which is expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs) and overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and PD-L2, which is primarily expressed on APCs. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation through the suppression of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent.

These cells are called Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes, or TIL and we have given this type of treatment to over 100 patients. In this study, we are selecting a specific subset of white blood cells from the tumor that we think are the most effective in fighting tumors and will use only these cells in making the tumor fighting cells. Objective: The purpose of this study is to see if these specifically selected tumor fighting cells can cause non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors to shrink and to see if this treatment is safe. Eligibility: - Adults age 18-70 with NSCLC who have a tumor that can be safely removed. Design: - Work up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the NIH clinical Center and undergo a history and physical examination, scans, x-rays, lab tests, and other tests as needed - Surgery: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will undergo surgery to remove a tumor that can be used to grow the TIL product. - Leukapheresis: Patients may undergo leukapheresis to obtain additional white blood cells. {Leukapheresis is a common procedure, which removes only the white blood cells from the patient.} - Treatment: Once their cells have grown, the patients will be admitted to the hospital for the conditioning chemotherapy, the TIL cells and aldesleukin. They will stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment. Follow up: Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side effects, lab tests, and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months to 1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking. Follow up visits take up to 2 days.","detail_description":"Background:\r\n\r\n        -  Patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have few approved\r\n           therapeutic options and those that exist are of transient benefit.\r\n\r\n        -  Recent clinical experiences with experimental agents that release checkpoints on the\r\n           host immune response (such as anti-PD-1 and anti-PDL1 antibody) have induced tumor\r\n           regressions in patients with NSCLC.\r\n\r\n        -  Data from sequencing the genomes of human cancers have shown that, like malignant\r\n           melanoma, NSCLC has a very high rate of tumor-specific genomic mutation.\r\n\r\n        -  In metastatic melanoma, a tumor infiltrating lymphocyte cell therapy product (TIL) can\r\n           mediate the regression of bulky disease at any site when administered to an autologous\r\n           patient with high dose aldesleukin following a non-myeloablative but lymphodepleting\r\n           chemotherapy preparative regimen.\r\n\r\n        -  Recent studies on tumor infiltrating lymphocytes from melanoma have demonstrated that\r\n           they can frequently recognize tumor-specific mutated proteins as foreign antigens and\r\n           that is one hypothesis as to why melanoma is such an immunogenic tumor.\r\n\r\n        -  We propose to investigate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of growing and\r\n           administering an autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocyte product (TIL) to patients with\r\n           metastatic NSCLC.\r\n\r\n      Objectives:\r\n\r\n      Primary objective:\r\n\r\n      -To determine the rate of tumor regression in patients with advanced non-small cell lung\r\n      cancer (NSCLC) who receive an autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocyte product (TIL) plus\r\n      aldesleukin following a lymphodepleting preparative regimen.\r\n\r\n      Eligibility:\r\n\r\n        -  Patients who are 18 years of age or older must have:\r\n\r\n             -  Advanced NSCLC refractory to standard therapy\r\n\r\n             -  A site of tumor that can be excised with minimal morbidity and mortality or that\r\n                requires excision for clinical indications\r\n\r\n             -  At least one remaining site of measurable disease\r\n\r\n             -  Normal basic laboratory values.\r\n\r\n        -  Patients may not have:\r\n\r\n             -  Concurrent major medical illnesses that preclude aldesleukin administration or\r\n                immunosuppression;\r\n\r\n             -  Severe hepatic function impairment due to liver metastatic burden;\r\n\r\n             -  Any form of immunodeficiency;\r\n\r\n             -  Severe hypersensitivity to any of the agents used in this study;\r\n\r\n             -  Symptomatic brain metastases or more than 3 CNS metastases\r\n\r\n      Design:\r\n\r\n        -  Patients will undergo biopsy or resection to obtain tumor for generation of autologous\r\n           tumor infiltrating lymphocyte cultures and autologous cancer cell lines.\r\n\r\n        -  The TIL product will be generated according to current TIL-lab standard operating\r\n           procedures, using interleukin-2 and OKT3 antibody.\r\n\r\n        -  All patients will receive a non-myeloablative lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen\r\n           of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine\r\n\r\n        -  Cohort 1 will receive TIL on day 0 and then begin high-dose aldesleukin (720,000 IU/kg\r\n           IV); cohort 2 will receive TIL on day 0 and then begin low-dose aldesleukin (72,000\r\n           IU/kg IV).

person. Researchers think this may help attack tumors in people with certain cancers. It is called gene transfer using anti-KRAS G12D mTCR cells. Objective: To see if anti-KRAS G12D mTCR cells are safe and cause tumors to shrink. Eligibility: Adults ages 18-70 who have cancer with a molecule on the tumors that can be recognized by the study cells Design: Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, scans, photography, and heart, lung, and lab tests. An intravenous (IV) catheter will be placed in a large vein in the chest. Participants will have leukapheresis. Blood will be removed through a needle in an arm. A machine will divide the blood and collect white blood cells. The rest of the blood will be returned to the participant through a needle in the other arm. A few weeks later, participants will have a hospital stay. They will: - Get 2 chemotherapy medicines by IV over 5 days. - Get the changed cells through the catheter. Get up to 9 doses of a medicine to help the cells. They may get a shot to stimulate blood cells. - Recover in the hospital for up to 3 weeks. They will provide blood samples. Participants will take an antibiotic for at least 6 months. Participants will have several follow-up visits over 2 years. They will repeat most of the screening tests and may have leukapheresis. Participants blood will be collected for several years.","detail_description":"Background:\r\n\r\n        -  We generated an HLA-A11:01-restricted murine T-cell receptor (mTCR) that specifically\r\n           recognizes the G12D-mutated variant of KRAS (and other RAS family genes) expressed by\r\n           many human cancers and constructed a single retroviral vector that contains alpha and\r\n           beta chains that confer recognition of this antigen when transduced into PBL.\r\n\r\n        -  In co-cultures with HLA-A11:01+ target cells expressing this mutated oncogene, mTCR\r\n           transduced T-cells lyse target cells and secrete IFN-y with high specificity.\r\n\r\n      Objectives:\r\n\r\n      -Primary objectives:\r\n\r\n        -  Phase I: Determine the safety of administering PBL transduced with anti-KRAS G12D mTCR\r\n           in concert with preparative lymphodepletion and high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2;\r\n           aldesleukin).\r\n\r\n        -  Phase II: Determine if anti-KRAS G12D mTCR-transduced PBL can mediate the regression of\r\n           tumors harboring the RAS G12D mutation.\r\n\r\n      Eligibility:\r\n\r\n        -  Patients must be/have:\r\n\r\n             -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years and less than or eqaul to 70 years\r\n\r\n             -  HLA-A*11:01 positive\r\n\r\n             -  Metastatic or unresectable RAS G12D-expressing cancer which has progressed after\r\n                standard therapy (if available).\r\n\r\n        -  Patients may not have:\r\n\r\n             -  Allergies or hypersensitivities to high-dose aldesleukin, cyclophosphamide, or\r\n                fludarabine.\r\n\r\n      Design:\r\n\r\n        -  This is a phase I/II, single center study of PBL transduced with anti-KRAS G12D mTCR in\r\n           HLA-A*11:01 positive patients with advanced solid tumors expressing G12D mutated RAS.\r\n\r\n        -  PBMC obtained by leukapheresis will be cultured in the presence of anti-CD3 (OKT3) and\r\n           aldesleukin in order to stimulate T-cell growth.\r\n\r\n        -  Transduction is initiated by exposure of these cells to retroviral vector supernatant\r\n           containing replication-incompetent virus encoding the anti-KRAS G12D mTCR.\r\n\r\n        -  All patients will receive a non-myeloablative, lymphodepleting preparative regimen of\r\n           cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.\r\n\r\n        -  On Day 0, patients will receive PBL transduced with the anti-KRAS G12D mTCR and will\r\n           then begin high-dose aldesleukin.\r\n\r\n        -  A complete evaluation of lesions will be conducted approximately 6 weeks (plus-minus 2\r\n           weeks) after treatment.\r\n\r\n        -  The study will be conducted using a phase I/II Simon minimax design, with two separate\r\n           cohorts for the Phase II component: Cohort 2a, patients with RAS G12D pancreatic cancer,\r\n           and Cohort 2b, patients with RAS G12D non-pancreatic cancer.\r\n\r\n        -  A total of up to 70 patients may be required; approximately 24 patients in the Phase I\r\n           portion of the study and 46 (21, plus an allowance of up to 2 non-evaluable per Phase II\r\n           cohort) patients in the Phase II portion of the study.","classification_code":null,"interventional_model":"SEQUENTIAL_ASSIGNMENT","study_source":"Institutional","accepts_healthy_volunteers_indicator":"NO","study_protocol_type":"Interventional","study_subtype_code":null,"study_population_description":null,"study_model_code":null,"study_model_other_text":null,"sampling_method_code":null,"why_study_stopped":"Requested

When cells are found that can attack the mutation in a person s tumor, the genes from those cells are studied to find the parts that make the attack possible. White blood cells are then taken from the person s body, and the gene transfer occurs in a laboratory. A type of virus is used to transfer the genes that make those white blood cells able to attack the mutation in the tumor. The gene transfer therapy is the return of those white blood cells back to the person. Objective: To see if gene transfer therapy of white blood cells can shrink tumors. Eligibility: People with certain metastatic cancer for which standard treatments have not worked. Design: Participants may complete screening under another protocol. Screening includes: - Getting tumor cells from a previous procedure - Medical history - Physical exam - Scans - Blood, urine, heart, and lung tests The study has 8 stages: 1. Screening tests repeated over 1-2 weeks. Participants will have leukapheresis: Blood is removed by a needle in one arm. A machine removes white blood cells. The rest of the blood is returned by a needle in the other arm. 2. Care at home over approximately 12 weeks. 3. Stopping therapy for 4-6 weeks while their cells are changed in a lab. 4. Hospital stay approximately 3-4 weeks for treatment. An IV catheter will be placed in the chest to administer drugs. 5. Patients on Arm 2 of the study will receive the first dose of pembrolizumab while in the hospital. Three additional doses will be given after the cell infusion 3 weeks apart. 6. Receiving changed cells by catheter. Then getting a drug over 1-5 days to help the cells live longer. 7. Recover in the hospital for 1-2 weeks. Participants will get drugs and have blood and urine tests. 8. Participants will take an antibiotic and maybe an antiviral for at least 6 months after treatment. They will have repeat screening tests at visits every few months for the first year, every 6 months for the second year, then as determined. ...","detail_description":"Background:\r\n\r\n        -  The administration of autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) can mediate\r\n           complete, durable regressions in 20-25% of participants with metastatic melanoma. Recent\r\n           studies have shown that these TIL predominantly recognize unique mutated neoantigens\r\n           expressed by the cancer not shared by other melanomas.\r\n\r\n        -  Administration of bulk autologous TIL to participants with a variety of other solid\r\n           cancers, including cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and genitourinary tract, have\r\n           little if any therapeutic impact.\r\n\r\n        -  Recent studies in the National Cancer Institute Surgery Branch, (NCI-SB), have shown\r\n           that TIL from non-melanoma solid cancers can also contain T-cells reactive against\r\n           non-shared unique mutated or oncoviral neoantigens expressed in the cancer. The\r\n           frequency of these T-cells is very low (often < 0.1%) and it is thus difficult to\r\n           isolate and grow mutation reactive T-cells to levels required for effective therapy.\r\n\r\n        -  In a single patient with chemo-refractory metastatic cholangiocarcinoma we were able to\r\n           grow a relatively pure population of neoantigen reactive TIL and administration of these\r\n           cells mediated a near-complete regression of all metastatic disease now lasting 2.5\r\n           years.\r\n\r\n        -  We have developed approaches to identify these rare neoantigen reactive T-cells from\r\n           common non-melanoma cancers, to isolate their T-cell receptors (TCR), and to genetically\r\n           engineer autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) to express these TCRs with high\r\n           efficiency. The neoantigen TCR gene-modified cells can recognize and destroy the\r\n           autologous cancer in vitro.\r\n\r\n        -  In addition to reactivity to neoantigens derived from nonsynonymous mutations, T-cells\r\n           can recognize human papilloma virus (HPV) epitopes in participants with HPV- induced\r\n           cancers. The TCR from these reactive cells can be isolated and retrovirally-transduced\r\n           into autologous PBL with high efficiency.\r\n\r\n        -  With these techniques, we have isolated a number of TCRs selectively recognizing shared\r\n           mutated oncogenes (e.g., KRAS, TP53) or shared oncoviral proteins (e.g. HPV) in the\r\n           context of several major histocompatibility complexes (MHC-I and MHC-II).\r\n\r\n        -  This clinical protocol will treat participants with refractory solid cancers using the\r\n           adoptive transfer of autologous PBL transduced with genes encoding TCRs that recognize\r\n           unique mutated or oncoviral neoantigens expressed by the cancer.\r\n\r\n      Objectives:\r\n\r\n      -Primary objective:\r\n\r\n      --Determine the rate of objective response (using RECIST v1.1 criteria) of participants with\r\n      solid cancers who receive pembrolizumab plus autologous PBL (Arm 2) that have been transduced\r\n      with genes encoding T-cell receptors that recognize mutated or oncoviral neoantigens in the\r\n      autologous cancer\r\n\r\n      Eligibility:\r\n\r\n      -Participants must be/have:\r\n\r\n        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years and less than or equal to 70 years\r\n\r\n        -  Metastatic solid cancer with at least one lesion that can be measured, that falls into\r\n           one of four cohorts: (1) gastrointestinal and genitourinary cancers; (2) breast,\r\n           ovarian, and other solid cancers; (3) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); and, (4)\r\n           endocrine tumors including neuroendocrine tumors.\r\n\r\n        -  Evaluable solid cancer that has recurred following standard chemotherapy or standard\r\n           systemic therapy\r\n\r\n        -  Normal basic laboratory values.\r\n\r\n        -  No allergies or hypersensitivity to high-dose aldesleukin administration\r\n\r\n        -  No concurrent major medical illnesses or any form of immunodeficiency.\r\n\r\n      Design:\r\n\r\n        -  Participants will have already undergone resection or biopsy to obtain tumor for\r\n           generation of autologous TIL cultures. This will have been conducted under the NCI-SB\r\n           cell harvest protocol 03-C-0277 (Cell Harvest and Preparation for Surgery Branch\r\n           Adoptive Cell Therapy Protocols).\r\n\r\n        -  Exomic sequencing, and often RNA-Seq will be performed to identify the mutations\r\n           expressed in the patient s cancer. Multiple autologous TIL cultures will be grown and\r\n           tested for reactivity against mutations from the autologous tumor using assays we have\r\n           developed that involve the exposure of autologous antigen-presenting cells to long\r\n           peptides containing the mutation or tandem mini-genes encoding the mutation.\r\n\r\n        -  T-cell cultures with reactivity against mutations will be identified and the individual\r\n           T- cell receptors that recognize the mutation will be synthesized and used to create a\r\n           retrovirus for transduction of the TCR into the patient s autologous PBL.\r\n\r\n        -  Participants that present with tumors expressing oncoviral neoantigens will be treated\r\n           with autologous PBLs retrovirally transduced with TCR(s) targeting the oncoviral\r\n           neoantigen.\r\n\r\n        -  Participants that present with tumors expressing mutated shared oncogenes (e.g., KRAS,\r\n           TP53) or oncoviral proteins (e.g., HPV) that also express the appropriate restriction\r\n           element may be treated with autologous PBLs retrovirally transduced with TCR(s)\r\n           previously isolated in the Surgery Branch targeting the shared mutated antigen. These\r\n           participants will be administered a cell infusion product of TCRs targeting mutated\r\n           shared oncogenes (e.g., KRAS, TP53) or oncoviral proteins (e.g., HPV). Their cell\r\n           infusion product will not include PBL transduced with unique (i.e., non-shared) TCR(s).\r\n\r\n        -  Participants will be enrolled into one of four cohorts: (1) metastatic gastrointestinal\r\n           and genitourinary cancers; (2) metastatic breast, ovarian, and other solid cancers; (3)\r\n           metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); and, (4) metastatic endocrine tumors\r\n           including neuroendocrine tumors. Autologous PBL transduced with TCR(s) targeting\r\n           neoantigens (mutated shared oncogenes e.g., TP53, KRAS, individual non-synonymous\r\n           mutations , or oncoviral proteins) will then be expanded to large numbers using our\r\n           standard rapid expansion protocol.\r\n\r\n        -  Participants enrolled on Arm 1 and Arm 2 will receive a non-myeloablative,\r\n           lymphodepleting preparative regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine\r\n           followed by the infusion of autologous transduced PBL and high-dose aldesleukin. At the\r\n           discretion of the Principal Investigator (PI), participants enrolled in Cohort 3 (NSCLC)\r\n           may receive low-dose aldesleukin.\r\n\r\n        -  Participants enrolled on Arm 2 will receive pembrolizumab prior to cell administration\r\n           and three additional doses every three weeks following the cell infusion. Participants\r\n           who have experienced major organ toxicity due to previous treatment with pembrolizumab\r\n           (or equivalent PD-1/PD-L1 blockade) will be enrolled on Arm 1.\r\n\r\n        -  Clinical and immunologic response will be evaluated about 4-6 weeks after cell infusion\r\n           and periodically thereafter.\r\n\r\n        -  It is anticipated that approximately one participant per month may enroll on the trial\r\n           for each of the four histologic cohorts for Arm 2. There will be a limit of 15\r\n           participants per cohort enrolled on Arm 1 (60 participants for Arm 1), and accrual of up\r\n           to 4 x 50 = 200 total evaluable participants on Arm 2. It is expected that once full\r\n           manufacturing capability is reached, the accrual may be completed in approximately 4-5\r\n           years. In order to allow for a small number of inevaluable participants, the accrual\r\n           ceiling will be set to 270.","classification_code":null,"interventional_model":"Parallel","study_source":"Institutional","accepts_healthy_volunteers_indicator":"NO","study_protocol_type":"Interventional","study_subtype_code":null,"study_population_description":null,"study_model_code":null,"study_model_other_text":null,"sampling_method_code":null,"why_study_stopped":"Requested by IRB","bio_specimen":{"f1":"bio_specimen_description","f2":null,"f3":"bio_specimen_retention_code","f4":null},"primary_purpose":{"primary_purpose_code":"TREATMENT","primary_purpose_other_text":null,"primary_purpose_additional_qualifier_code":null},"phase":{"phase":"II","phase_other_text":null,"phase_additional_qualifier_code":null},"masking":{"masking":null,"masking_allocation_code":"Non-Randomized Trial","masking_role_investigator":null,"masking_role_outcome_assessor":null,"masking_role_subject":null,"masking_role_caregiver":null},"principal_investigator":"Steven A.

Various cytoplasmic signaling molecules are recruited to the activated receptor complex and become substrates for regulatory enzymes that are associated with the receptor complex. This agent enhances lymphocyte mitogenesis; stimulates long-term growth of human IL-2 dependent cell lines; enhances lymphocyte cytotoxicity; induces lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell and natural killer (NK) cell activities; and induces expression of interferon-gamma.

Upon administration, pembrolizumab binds to PD-1, an inhibitory signaling receptor expressed on the surface of activated T cells, and blocks the binding to and activation of PD-1 by its ligands, which results in the activation of T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. The ligands for PD-1 include PD-L1, which is expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs) and overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and PD-L2, which is primarily expressed on APCs. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation through the suppression of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Check for active clinical trials or closed clinical trials using this agent.
