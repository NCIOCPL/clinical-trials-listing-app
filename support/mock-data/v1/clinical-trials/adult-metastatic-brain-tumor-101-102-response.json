			"brief_summary": "Background: A new cancer therapy takes white blood cells from a person, grows them in a lab, genetically changes them, then gives them back to the person. Researchers think this may help attack tumors in people with certain cancers. It is called gene transfer using anti-KRAS G12D mTCR cells. Objective: To see if anti-KRAS G12D mTCR cells are safe and cause tumors to shrink. Eligibility: Adults ages 18-70 who have cancer with a molecule on the tumors that can be recognized by the study cells Design: Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, scans, photography, and heart, lung, and lab tests. An intravenous (IV) catheter will be placed in a large vein in the chest. Participants will have leukapheresis. Blood will be removed through a needle in an arm. A machine will divide the blood and collect white blood cells. The rest of the blood will be returned to the participant through a needle in the other arm. A few weeks later, participants will have a hospital stay. They will: - Get 2 chemotherapy medicines by IV over 5 days. - Get the changed cells through the catheter. Get up to 9 doses of a medicine to help the cells. They may get a shot to stimulate blood cells. - Recover in the hospital for up to 3 weeks. They will provide blood samples. Participants will take an antibiotic for at least 6 months. Participants will have several follow-up visits over 2 years. They will repeat most of the screening tests and may have leukapheresis. Participants blood will be collected for several years.",

			"brief_summary": "Background: A person s tumor is studied for mutations. When cells are found that can attack the mutation in a person s tumor, the genes from those cells are studied to find the parts that make the attack possible. White blood cells are then taken from the person s body, and the gene transfer occurs in a laboratory. A type of virus is used to transfer the genes that make those white blood cells able to attack the mutation in the tumor. The gene transfer therapy is the return of those white blood cells back to the person. Objective: To see if gene transfer therapy of white blood cells can shrink tumors. Eligibility: People with certain metastatic cancer for which standard treatments have not worked. Design: Participants may complete screening under another protocol. Screening includes: - Getting tumor cells from a previous procedure - Medical history - Physical exam - Scans - Blood, urine, heart, and lung tests The study has 8 stages: 1. Screening tests repeated over 1-2 weeks. Participants will have leukapheresis: Blood is removed by a needle in one arm. A machine removes white blood cells. The rest of the blood is returned by a needle in the other arm. 2. Care at home over approximately 12 weeks. 3. Stopping therapy for 4-6 weeks while their cells are changed in a lab. 4. Hospital stay approximately 3-4 weeks for treatment. An IV catheter will be placed in the chest to administer drugs. 5. Patients on Arm 2 of the study will receive the first dose of pembrolizumab while in the hospital. Three additional doses will be given after the cell infusion 3 weeks apart. 6. Receiving changed cells by catheter. Then getting a drug over 1-5 days to help the cells live longer. 7. Recover in the hospital for 1-2 weeks. Participants will get drugs and have blood and urine tests. 8. Participants will take an antibiotic and maybe an antiviral for at least 6 months after treatment. They will have repeat screening tests at visits every few months for the first year, every 6 months for the second year, then as determined. ...",

Eligibility: Adults at least 18 years old with cancer that has the KRAS G12V molecule on the surface of tumors. Design: In another protocol, participants will: Be screened Have cells harvested and grown Have leukapheresis In this protocol, participants will have the procedures below. Participants will be admitted to the hospital. Over 5 days, participants will get 2 chemotherapy medicines as an infusion via catheter in the upper chest. A few days later, participants will get the anti-KRAS G12V mTCR cells via catheter. For up to 3 days, participants will get a drug to make the cells active. A day after getting the cells, participants will get a drug to increase their white blood cell count. This will be a shot or injection under the skin. Participants will recover in the hospital for 1-2 weeks. They will have lab and blood tests. Participants will take an antibiotic for at least 6 months. Participants will have visits every few months for 2 years, and then as determined by their doctor. Visits will be 1-2 days. They will include lab tests, imaging studies, and physical exam. Some visits may include leukapheresis or blood drawn. Participants will have blood collected over several years.",
